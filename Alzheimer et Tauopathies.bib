	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified PICALM as one of the most significant susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) after APOE and BIN1. PICALM is a clathrin-adaptor protein and plays critical roles in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and in autophagy. PICALM modulates brain amyloid ß (Aß) pathology and tau accumulation. We have previously reported that soluble PICALM protein level is reduced in correlation with abnormalities of autophagy markers in the affected brain areas of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, sporadic tauopathies and familial cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau-immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-tau) with mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. It remains unclarified whether in vivo PICALM reduction could either trigger or influence tau pathology progression in the brain. In this study, we confirmed a significant reduction of soluble PICALM protein and autophagy deficits in the post-mortem human brains of FTLD-tau-MAPT (P301L, S364S and L266V). We generated a novel transgenic mouse line named Tg30xPicalm+/- by crossing Tg30 tau transgenic mice with Picalm-haploinsufficient mice to test whether Picalm reduction may modulate tau pathology. While Picalm haploinsufficiency did not lead to any motor phenotype or detectable tau pathology in mouse brains, Tg30xPicalm+/-  mice developed markedly more severe motor deficits than Tg30 by the age of 9 months. Tg30xPicalm+/-  had significantly higher pathological tau levels in the brain, an increased density of neurofibrillary tangles compared to Tg30 mice and increased abnormalities of autophagy markers. Our results demonstrate that Picalm haploinsufficiency in transgenic Tg30 mice significantly aggravated tau pathologies and tau-mediated neurodegeneration, supporting a role for changes in Picalm expression as a risk/sensitizing factor for development of tau pathology and as a mechanism underlying the AD risk associated to PICALM.},

	abstract = {The term "propagon" is used to define proteins that may transmit misfolding in vitro, in tissues or in organisms. Among propagons, misfolded tau is thought to be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of various "tauopathies" that include Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and argyrophilic grain disease. Here, we review the available data in the literature and point out how the prion-like tau propagation has been extended from Alzheimer's disease to tauopathies. First, in Alzheimer's disease, the progression of tau aggregation follows stereotypical anatomical stages which may be considered as spreading. The mechanisms of the propagation are now subject to intensive and controversial research. It has been shown that tau may be secreted in the interstitial fluid in an active manner as reflected by high and constant concentration of extracellular tau during Alzheimer's pathology. Animal and cell models have been devised to mimic tau seeding and propagation, and despite their limitations, they have further supported to the prion-like propagation hypothesis. Finally, such new ways of thinking have led to different therapeutic strategies in anti-tau immunotherapy among tauopathies and have stimulated new clinical trials. However, it appears that the prion-like propagation hypothesis mainly relies on data obtained in Alzheimer's disease. From this review, it appears that further studies are needed (1) to characterize extracellular tau species, (2) to find the right pathological tau species to target, (3) to follow in vivo tau pathology by brain imaging and biomarkers and (4) to interpret current clinical trial results aimed at reducing the progression of these pathologies. Such inputs will be essential to have a comprehensive view of these promising therapeutic strategies in tauopathies.},

	abstract = {Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by excessive weight loss, persistent food restriction and inappropriate physical activity relative to declining energy balance. The comorbidity with depression and/or anxiety disorders might contribute to the "chronicization" of the disease. We aimed here to question first the link between physical activity and anxiety from a clinical investigation of AN patients (n = 206). Then, using a rodent model mimicking numerous physiological and metabolic alterations commonly seen in AN patients, we examined whether 1) chronic food restriction increased anxiety-like behaviour and 2) physical activity plays a role in regulating anxiety levels. To this end, we exposed young female mice to a chronic food restriction (FR, n = 8) paradigm combined or not with access to a running wheel (FRW, n = 8) for two weeks. The mice were compared to a group of mice fed ad libitum without (AL, n = 6) or with running wheel access (ALW, n = 8). We explored anxiety-like behaviour of all mice in the following tests: hyponeophagia, marble burying, elevated plus maze, open field, and the light and dark box. On the last day, we used a restraint test of 30 min duration and measured their stress reactivity by assaying plasma corticosterone. In the open field and the elevated plus-maze, we found that FRW mice behaved similarly to AL and ALW mice whereas FR mice did not express anxiety-like behaviour. The FRW mice displayed the lowest latency to reach the food in the hyponeophagia test. Regarding stress reactivity, FRW mice exhibited corticosterone reactivity after acute stress that was similar to the control mice, while FR mice did not fully return to basal corticosterone at one hour after the restraint stress. Taken together, these data demonstrate a differential reactivity to acute stress in FR conditions and a beneficial effect of running wheel activity in ALW and FRW conditions. Moreover, we report the absence of a typical anxiety-like behaviour associated with the food restriction (FR and FRW groups). We conclude that this model (FR and FRW mice) did not express typical anxiety-like behaviour, but that physical activity linked to food restriction improved coping strategies in an anxiogenic context.},

	abstract = {Tau hyperphosphorylation is a major neuropathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Several anesthetics have been shown previously to induced marked tau hyperphosphorylation. Although the ketamine/xylazine mixture is one of the most commonly used anesthetic agents in animal research and veterinary practice, the effect of this anesthetic agent on tau phosphorylation still remains to be determined. Here, we found that ketamine-/xylazine-induced a rapid and robust hyperphosphorylation of tau in a dose-dependent manner under normothermic and hypothermic conditions in mice. When used together, ketamine and xylazine exerted a synergistic action on tau phosphorylation most strongly not only on epitopes S396 and S262, but also on other residues (T181, and S202/T205). We observed that activation of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is the major upstream molecular event leading to tau hyperphosphorylation following ketamine/xylazine anesthesia in mice. Moreover, we observed that intracerebroventricular injection of the selective CaMKII inhibitor KN93 attenuated tau hyperphosphorylation. Since ketamine/xylazine also had a marked impact on other key molecular signaling pathways involving the MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), our study calls for high caution and careful monitoring when using this anesthetic agent in laboratory animal settings across all fields of biological sciences in order to avoid artifactual results.},

To this end, we performed intra-hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and PTZ (pentylenetetrazol) seizure threshold tests in THY-Tau22 transgenic mice of AD-like tau pathology. We demonstrate that despite a lack of spontaneous epileptiform activity in Tau22 mice, the animals display increased PTZ-induced seizure susceptibility and mortality. The increased propensity for induced seizures in THY-Tau22 mutants correlates with astrogliosis and increased expression of adenosine kinase, consistent with increased network excitability. These data support an impact of tau pathology toward AD-associated seizures and suggest that tau pathology may contribute to seizure generation in AD independent of Aβ pathology.},

Immunofluorescence labeling showed TMEM240 to be expressed in various areas of the brain, with the highest levels in the hippocampus, isocortex, and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, TMEM240 was detected in the deep nuclei and the cerebellar cortex. The protein was expressed in all three layers of the cortex and various cerebellar neurons. TMEM240 was localized to climbing, mossy, and parallel fiber afferents projecting to Purkinje cells, as shown by co-immunostaining with VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Co-immunostaining with synaptophysin, post-synaptic fractionation, and confirmatory electron microscopy showed TMEM240 to be localized to the post-synaptic side of synapses near the Purkinje-cell soma. Similar results were obtained in human cerebellar sections. These data suggest that TMEM240 may be involved in the organization of the cerebellar network, particularly in synaptic inputs converging on Purkinje cells. This study is the first to describe TMEM240 expression in the normal mouse brain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate cognitive inhibition in presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and its associated neuroanatomical correlates.
METHODS: Thirty-eight presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+, mean age 38.2±8.0 years) and 22 C9- controls from the PREV-DEMALS cohort were included in this study. They underwent a cognitive inhibition assessment with the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT; time to completion (part B-part A); error score in part B) as well as a 3D MRI.
RESULTS: C9+ individuals younger than 40 years had higher error scores (part B) but equivalent HSCT time to completion (part B-part A) compared to C9- individuals. C9+ individuals older than 40 years had both higher error scores and longer time to completion. HSCT time to completion significantly predicted the proximity to estimated clinical conversion from presymptomatic to symptomatic phase in C9+ individuals (based on the average age at onset of affected relatives in the family). Anatomically, we found that HSCT time to completion was associated with the integrity of the cerebellum.
CONCLUSION: The HSCT represents a good marker of cognitive inhibition impairments in C9+ and of proximity to clinical conversion. This study also highlights the key role of the cerebellum in cognitive inhibition.},

The capacity to stimulate wound healing was evaluated by a scratch assay, and the capacity to differentiate SH-SY5Y into neurons was also examined. Platelet lysates contained a range of neurotrophins. They were not toxic to SH-SY5Y, EA-hy926, or BV-2 cells, did not induce the expression of TNF or COX-2 inflammatory markers by BV-2 microglia, and decreased inflammation after LPS stimulation. They stimulated the wound closure in the scratch assay and induced SH-SY5Y differentiation as revealed by the increased length of neurites as well as β3-tubulin and neurofilament staining. These data confirm the therapeutic potential of platelet lysates in the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system and support further evaluation as novel neurorestorative biotherapy in preclinical models.},

A unique gene expression module, highly enriched for AD risk genes, is specifically responsive to Aβ but not TAU pathology. We identify in this module 7 established AD risk genes (APOE, CLU, INPP5D, CD33, PLCG2, SPI1, and FCER1G) and 11 AD GWAS genes below the genome-wide significance threshold (GPC2, TREML2, SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, SAMSN1, PYDC1, HEXB, RRBP1, LYN, and BLNK), that become significantly upregulated when exposed to Aβ. Single microglia sequencing confirms that Aβ, not TAU, pathology induces marked transcriptional changes in microglia, including increased proportions of activated microglia.

We report, for the first time, a significant overexpression of A2AR in hippocampal neurons of aged humans, which is aggravated in AD patients. A similar profile of A2AR overexpression in rats was sufficient to drive age-like memory impairments in young animals and to uncover a hippocampal LTD-to-LTP shift. This was accompanied by increased NMDA receptor gating, dependent on mGluR5 and linked to enhanced Ca2+ influx. We confirmed the same plasticity shift in memory-impaired aged rats and APP/PS1 mice modeling AD, which was rescued upon A2AR blockade. This A2AR/mGluR5/NMDAR interaction might prove a suitable alternative for regulating aberrant mGluR5/NMDAR signaling in AD without disrupting their constitutive activity.},

	abstract = {Insoluble intracellular aggregation of tau proteins into filaments and neurodegeneration are histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies. Recently, prefibrillar, soluble, oligomeric tau intermediates have emerged as relevant pathological tau species; however, the molecular mechanisms of neuronal responses to tau oligomers are not fully understood. Here, we show that hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mouse model of tauopathy, THY-Tau22, are enriched with oligomeric tau, contain elongated mitochondria, and display cellular stress, but no overt cytotoxicity compared to the control mice. The levels of several key mitochondrial proteins were markedly different between the THY-Tau22 and control mice hippocampi including the mitochondrial SIRT3, PINK1, ANT1 and the fission protein DRP1. DNA base excision repair (BER) is the primary defense system against oxidative DNA damage and it was elevated in six-month-old transgenic mice. DNA polymerase β, the key BER DNA polymerase, was enriched in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons in six-month-old transgenic mice and localized with and within mitochondria. Polβ also co-localized with mitochondria in human AD brains in neurons containing oligomeric tau. Most of these altered mitochondrial and DNA repair events were specific to the transgenic mice at 6 months of age and were not different from control mice at 12 months of age when tau pathology reaches its maximum and oligomeric forms of tau are no longer detectable. In summary, our data suggests that we have identified key cellular stress responses at early stages of tau pathology to preserve neuronal integrity and to promote survival. To our knowledge, this work provides the first description of multiple stress responses involving mitochondrial homeostasis and BER early during the progression of tau pathology, and represents an important advance in the etiopathogenesis of tauopathies.},

	abstract = {Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intraneuronal accumulation of aggregated tau. The staging of this neurodegenerative process is well established for Alzheimer's disease as well as for other tauopathies. The stereotypical pattern of tau pathology in these diseases is consistent with the hypothesis that the tau protein can spread in a 'prion-like' manner. It proposes that extracellular pathological tau species can transmit pathology from cell to cell. Accordingly, by targeting these spreading species with therapeutic antibodies one should be able to slow or halt the progression of tau pathology. To be effective, antibodies should neutralize the pathological species present in Alzheimer's disease brains and block their cell-to-cell spread. To evaluate both aspects, tau antibody D, which recognizes an epitope in the central region of tau, and was selected for its outstanding ability to block tau seeding in cell based assays, was used in this study. Here, we addressed two fundamental questions: (i) can this anti-tau antibody neutralize the pathological species present in Alzheimer's disease brains; and (ii) can it block the cell-to-cell spread of tau seeds in vivo? First, antibody D effectively prevented the induction of tau pathology in the brains of transgenic mice that had been injected with human Alzheimer's disease brain extracts, showing that it could effectively neutralize the pathological species present in these extracts. Second, by using K18 P301L tau fibrils to induce pathology, we further demonstrated that antibody D was also capable of blocking the progression of tau pathology to distal brain regions. In contrast, an amino-terminal tau antibody, which was less effective at blocking tau seeding in vitro showed less efficacy in reducing Alzheimer's disease patient tau driven pathology in the transgenic mouse model. We did not address whether the same is true for a spectrum of other amino-terminal antibodies that were tested in vitro. These data highlight important differences between tau antibodies and, when taken together with other recently published data, suggest that epitope may be important for function.},

Here, we tested the long-term consequences of early life exposure to caffeine in THY-Tau22 transgenic mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease-like Tau pathology. Caffeine exposed mutant offspring developed cognitive earlier than water treated mutants. Electrophysiological recordings of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro revealed that early life exposure to caffeine changed the way the glutamatergic and GABAergic drives were modified by the Tau pathology. We conclude that early-life exposure to caffeine affects the Tau phenotype and we suggest that caffeine exposure during pregnancy may constitute a risk-factor for early onset of Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.},

	abstract = {A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) is playing a central role in flagellar structure, chemotaxis, capacitation and sperm motility. In mammals, AKAP4 is expressed during spermatogenesis. AKAP4 is synthesized as a precursor, proAKAP4, which is cleaved into mature AKAP4 during fibrous sheath assembly. The proAKAP4 is a good indicator of sperm quality in humans and boars. The aims of this work were to study the expression, the localization and the concentration of proAKAP4 and AKAP4 in equine semen, and to evaluate the possible correlation between the total and progressive motility and the concentration of proAKAP4 measured by ELISA in post-thawed semen. Frozen sperm from 13 different stallions were used. Semen samples (n = 17) were prepared using the INRA Freeze medium to reach a concentration of 150 million spermatozoa/mL, packaged and frozen in 0.5 mL straws. The precursor proAKAP4 and the mature protein AKAP4 both localize to the fibrous sheath of the principle piece of equine sperm flagellum. The concentrations of proAKAP4 were determined in the post-thawed semen using ELISA method (Horse 4MID® kits, 4BioDx, France). The mean concentration of proAKAP4 was then of 7.372 ± 0.79 ng/μL and was significantly correlated with the post-thawed total motility (Pearson coefficient r = 0.66, p = 0.002) and progressive motility (Pearson coefficient r = 0.76, p = 0.0002) and the amount of proAKAP4 represent the amount of spermatozoa that expressed proAKAP4. Taken together, these preliminary results confirm the interest to use proAKAP4 concentrations as a promising marker of stallion sperm quality as close correlation was observed between the proAKAP4 concentration and sperm motility parameters.},

	abstract = {The pathomechanisms that associate a deficit in folate and/or vitamin B12 and the subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia with pathological brain ageing are unclear. We investigated the homocysteinylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, and in rats depleted in folate and vitamin B12, Cd320 KO mice with selective B12 brain deficiency and H19-7 neuroprogenitors lacking folate. Compared with controls, N-homocysteinylated tau and MAP1 were increased and accumulated in protein aggregates and tangles in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of patients and animals. N-homocysteinylation dissociated tau and MAPs from β-tubulin, and MS analysis showed that it targets lysine residues critical for their binding to β-tubulin. N-homocysteinylation increased in rats exposed to vitamin B12 and folate deficit during gestation and lactation and remained significantly higher when they became 450 days-old, despite returning to normal diet at weaning, compared with controls. It was correlated with plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and brain expression of methionine tRNAsynthetase (MARS), the enzyme required for the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone, the substrate of N-homocysteinylation. Experimental inactivation of MARS prevented the N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1, and the dissociation of tau and MAP1 from β-tubulin and PSD95 in cultured neuroprogenitors. In conclusion, increased N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is a mechanism of brain ageing that depends on Hcy concentration and expression of MARS enzyme. Its irreversibility and cumulative occurrence throughout life may explain why B12 and folate supplementation of the elderly has limited effects, if any, to prevent pathological brain ageing and cognitive decline.

	abstract = {Accumulating data support the role of tau pathology in cognitive decline in ageing and Alzheimer's disease, but underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined. Interestingly, ageing and Alzheimer's disease have been associated with an abnormal upregulation of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), a fine tuner of synaptic plasticity. However, the link between A2AR signalling and tau pathology has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we report for the first time a significant upregulation of A2AR in patients suffering from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with the MAPT P301L mutation. To model these alterations, we induced neuronal A2AR upregulation in a tauopathy mouse model (THY-Tau22) using a new conditional strain allowing forebrain overexpression of the receptor. We found that neuronal A2AR upregulation increases tau hyperphosphorylation, potentiating the onset of tau-induced memory deficits. This detrimental effect was linked to a singular microglial signature as revealed by RNA sequencing analysis. In particular, we found that A2AR overexpression in THY-Tau22 mice led to the hippocampal upregulation of C1q complement protein-also observed in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration-and correlated with the loss of glutamatergic synapses, likely underlying the observed memory deficits. These data reveal a key impact of overactive neuronal A2AR in the onset of synaptic loss in tauopathies, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches.},

In patients suffering hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone supplementation offers the prospect to alleviate the cognitive consequences of hypothyroidism; however, the therapeutic value of TH supplementation remains at present uncertain and the link between cellular modifications associated with hypothyroidism and neurodegeneration remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we therefore evaluated the molecular and behavioral consequences of T3 hormone replacement in an animal model of hypothyroidism. We have previously reported that the antithyroid molecule propylthiouracil (PTU) given in the drinking water favors cerebral atrophy, brain neuroinflammation, Aβ production, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and altered plasticity-related cell-signaling pathways in the hippocampus in association with hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficits. In the present study, our aim was to explore, in this model, the effect of hippocampal T3 signaling normalization on various molecular mechanisms involved in learning and memory that goes awry under conditions of hypothyroidism and to evaluate its potential for recovery of hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. We report that T3 supplementation can alleviate hippocampal-dependent memory impairments displayed by hypothyroid rats and normalize key markers of thyroid status in the hippocampus, of neuroinflammation, Aβ production, and of cell-signaling pathways known to be involved in synaptic plasticity and memory function. Together, these findings suggest that normalization of hippocampal T3 signaling is sufficient to reverse molecular and cognitive dysfunctions associated with hypothyroidism.},

In Alzheimer's disease, tau aggregates into filaments, leading to the observation of intraneuronal fibrillary tangles. Molecular mechanisms resulting in tau aggregation and in tau pathology spreading through the brain regions are still not fully understood. New tools are thus needed to decipher tau pathways involved in the diseases. In this context, a family of novel single domain antibody fragments, or VHHs, directed against tau were generated and characterized. Among the selected VHHs obtained from screening of a synthetic library, a family of six VHHs shared the same CDR3 recognition loop and recognized the same epitope, located in the C-terminal domain of tau. Affinity parameters characterizing the tau/VHHs interaction were next evaluated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. The equilibrium constants KD were in the micromolar range, but despite conservation of the CDR3 loop sequence, a range of affinities was observed for this VHH family. One of these VHHs, named F8-2, was additionally shown to bind tau upon expression in a neuronal cell line model. Optimization of VHH F8-2 by yeast two-hybrid allowed the generation of an optimized VHH family characterized by lower KD than that of the F8-2 wild-type counterpart, and recognizing the same epitope. The optimized VHHs can also be used as antibodies for detecting tau in transgenic mice brain tissues. These results validate the use of these VHHs for in vitro studies, but also their potential for in-cell expression and assays in mouse models, to explore the mechanisms underlying tau physiopathology.},

In the present study, we focused on putative effects of AD-related pathologies on depotentiation (DP), another form of synaptic plasticity. Using a novel protocol to induce DP in the CA1-region, we found in 11-15 months old male THY-Tau22 and APPPS1-21 transgenic mice that DP was not deteriorated by Aß pathology while significantly compromised by Tau pathology.

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive alterations, cerebral atrophy and neuropathological lesions including neuronal loss, accumulation of misfolded and aggregated β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and tau proteins. Iatrogenic induction of Aβ is suspected in patients exposed to pituitary-derived hormones, dural grafts, or surgical instruments, presumably contaminated with Aβ. Induction of Aβ and tau lesions has been demonstrated in transgenic mice after contamination with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates, with very limited functional consequences. Unlike rodents, primates naturally express Aβ or tau under normal conditions and attempts to transmit Alzheimer pathology to primates have been made for decades. However, none of earlier studies performed any detailed functional assessments. For the first time we demonstrate long term memory and learning impairments in a non-human primate (Microcebus murinus) following intracerebral injections with Alzheimer human brain extracts. Animals inoculated with Alzheimer brain homogenates displayed progressive cognitive impairments (clinical tests assessing cognitive and motor functions), modifications of neuronal activity (detected by electroencephalography), widespread and progressive cerebral atrophy (in vivo MRI assessing cerebral volume loss using automated voxel-based analysis), neuronal loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (post mortem stereology). They displayed parenchymal and vascular Aβ depositions and tau lesions for some of them, in regions close to the inoculation sites. Although these lesions were sparse, they were never detected in control animals. Tau-positive animals had the lowest performances in a memory task and displayed the greatest neuronal loss. Our study is timely and important as it is the first one to highlight neuronal and clinical dysfunction following inoculation of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates in a primate. Clinical signs in a chronic disease such as Alzheimer take a long time to be detectable. Documentation of clinical deterioration and/or dysfunction following intracerebral inoculations with Alzheimer human brain extracts could lead to important new insights about Alzheimer initiation processes.},

	abstract = {Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported as a feature of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies and might contribute to defects in learning and memory in these diseases. To assess the interference of tau pathology, a common key-lesion in these diseases, with adult hippocampal neurogenesis we analyzed adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in wild-type mice, Tg30 mice expressing a FTDP-17 mutant tau and the same Tg30 mice deficient for mouse tau (Tg30/tauKO). The volume of the granular layer, the number of granule cells and of neuronal precursors expressing the immature markers DCX or 3R-tau were analyzed in the dentate gyrus (DG) using unbiased stereological methods. The co-localization of neurogenic markers with the human mutant tau was also analyzed. We observed a significant reduction of the volume of the granular layer and of granule cells number in mutant tau Tg30 mice, but not in Tg30/tauKO mice. The number of neuronal precursors expressing the immature markers DCX or 3R-tau (the latter only expressed in wild-type and Tg30 mice) and the number of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki-67 in the neurogenic subgranular zone of the DG was reduced in Tg30 but not in Tg30/tauKO mice. The density of phosphotau positive cells in the DG and the level of soluble human phosphotau was lower in Tg30/tauKO compared to Tg30 mice. The human mutant tau was expressed in mature granule cells in Tg30 and Tg30/tauKO mice but was not expressed in Sox2 positive neural stem cells and in DCX positive neuronal precursors/immature newborn neurons. These results demonstrate an impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in a FTDP-17 mutant tau mice resulting from a decrease of proliferation affecting the pool of neuronal precursors. The mutant tau was not expressed in precursors cells in these mutant tau mice, suggesting that this neurogenic defect is cell non-autonomous. Interestingly, expression of endogenous wild-type tau in mature granule cells was necessary to observe this toxic effect of human mutant tau, since this impaired adult neurogenesis was rescued by lowering tau expression in Tg30/tauKO mice. These observations suggest that development of tau pathology in granule cells of the dentate gyrus is responsible for reduction of adult hippocampal neurogenesis also in human tauopathies by impairing proliferation of neuronal precursors, and that reduction of tau expression might be an approach to rescue this impairment.},

The NLRP3 inflammasome assembles inside of microglia on activation, leading to increased cleavage and activity of caspase-1 and downstream interleukin-1β release2. Although the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to be essential for the development and progression of amyloid-beta pathology in mice3, the precise effect on tau pathology remains unknown. Here we show that loss of NLRP3 inflammasome function reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation by regulating tau kinases and phosphatases. Tau activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and intracerebral injection of fibrillar amyloid-beta-containing brain homogenates induced tau pathology in an NLRP3-dependent manner. These data identify an important role of microglia and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the pathogenesis of tauopathies and support the amyloid-cascade hypothesis in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating that neurofibrillary tangles develop downstream of amyloid-beta-induced microglial activation.},

	abstract = {Tau neuronal and glial pathologies drive the clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease and related human tauopathies. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that pathological tau species can travel from cell to cell and spread the pathology through the brain. Throughout the last decade, physiological and pathological tau have become attractive targets for AD therapies. Several therapeutic approaches have been proposed, including the inhibition of protein kinases or protein-3-O-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)-L-serine/threonine Nacetylglucosaminyl hydrolase, the inhibition of tau aggregation, active and passive immunotherapies, and tau silencing by antisense oligonucleotides. New tau therapeutics, across the board, have demonstrated the ability to prevent or reduce tau lesions and improve either cognitive or motor impairment in a variety of animal models developing neurofibrillary pathology. The most advanced strategy for the treatment of human tauopathies remains immunotherapy, which has already reached the clinical stage of drug development. Tau vaccines or humanised antibodies target a variety of tau species either in the intracellular or extracellular spaces. Some of them recognise the amino-terminus or carboxy-terminus, while others display binding abilities to the proline-rich area or microtubule binding domains. The main therapeutic foci in existing clinical trials are on Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and non-fluent primary progressive aphasia. Tau therapy offers a new hope for the treatment of many fatal brain disorders. First efficacy data from clinical trials will be available by the end of this decade.},

	abstract = {Accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated and aggregated Tau proteins is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Tauopathies. AD patient brains also exhibit insulin resistance. Whereas, under normal physiological conditions insulin signaling in the brain mediates plasticity and memory formation, it can also regulate peripheral energy homeostasis. Thus, in AD, brain insulin resistance affects both cognitive and metabolic changes described in these patients. While a role of Aβ oligomers and APOE4 towards the development of brain insulin resistance emerged, contribution of Tau pathology has been largely overlooked. Our recent data demonstrated that one of the physiological function of Tau is to sustain brain insulin signaling. We postulated that under pathological conditions, hyper-phosphorylated/aggregated Tau is likely to lose this function and to favor the development of brain insulin resistance. This hypothesis was substantiated by observations from patient brains with pure Tauopathies. To address the potential link between Tau pathology and brain insulin resistance, we have evaluated the brain response to insulin in a transgenic mouse model of AD-like Tau pathology (THY-Tau22). Using electrophysiological and biochemical evaluations, we surprisingly observed that, at a time when Tau pathology and cognitive deficits are overt and obvious, the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 mice exhibits enhanced response to insulin. In addition, we demonstrated that the ability of i.c.v. insulin to promote body weight loss is enhanced in THY-Tau22 mice. In line with this, THY-Tau22 mice exhibited a lower body weight gain, hypoleptinemia and hypoinsulinemia and finally a metabolic resistance to high-fat diet. The present data highlight that the brain of transgenic Tau mice exhibit enhanced brain response to insulin. Whether these observations are ascribed to the development of Tau pathology, and therefore relevant to human Tauopathies, or unexpectedly results from the Tau transgene overexpression is debatable and discussed.},

	abstract = {The functional preservation of the central nervous system (CNS) is based on the neuronal plasticity and survival. In this context, the neuroinflammatory state plays a key role and involves the microglial cells, the CNS-resident macrophages. In order to better understand the microglial contribution to the neuroprotection, microglia-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated and molecularly characterized to be then studied in neurite outgrowth assays. The EVs, mainly composed of exosomes and microparticles, are an important cell-to-cell communication process as they exhibit different types of mediators (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids) to recipient cells. The medicinal leech CNS was initially used as an interesting model of microglia/neuron crosstalk due to their easy collection for primary cultures. After the microglia-derived EV isolation following successive methods, we developed their large-scale and non-targeted proteomic analysis to (i) detect as many EV protein markers as possible, (ii) better understand the biologically active proteins in EVs and (iii) evaluate the resulting protein signatures in EV-activated neurons. The EV functional properties were also evaluated in neurite outgrowth assays on rat primary neurons and the RNAseq analysis of the microglia-derived EVs was performed to propose the most representative miRNAs in microglia-derived EVs. This strategy allowed validating the EV isolation, identify major biological pathways in EVs and corroborate the regenerative process in EV-activated neurons. In parallel, six different miRNAs were originally identified in microglia-derived EVs including 3 which were only known in plants until now. The analysis of the neuronal proteins under the microglial EV activation suggested possible miRNA-dependent regulation mechanisms. Taken together, this combination of methodologies showed the leech microglial EVs as neuroprotective cargos across species and contributed to propose original EV-associated miRNAs whose functions will have to be evaluated in the EV-dependent dialog between microglia and neurons.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most frequent cause of dementia, is escalating as a global epidemic, and so far, there is neither cure nor treatment to alter its progression. The most important feature of the disease is neuronal death and loss of cognitive functions, caused probably from several pathological processes in the brain. The main neuropathological features of AD are widely described as amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of the aggregated protein tau, which contribute to the disease. Nevertheless, AD brains suffer from a variety of alterations in function, such as energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic activity. The latest decades have seen an explosion of genes and molecules that can be employed as targets aiming to improve brain physiology, which can result in preventive strategies for AD. Moreover, therapeutics using these targets can help AD brains to sustain function during the development of AD pathology. Here, we review broadly recent information for potential targets that can modify AD through diverse pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches including gene therapy. We propose that AD could be tackled not only using combination therapies including Aβ and tau, but also considering insulin and cholesterol metabolism, vascular function, synaptic plasticity, epigenetics, neurovascular junction and blood-brain barrier targets that have been studied recently. We also make a case for the role of gut microbiota in AD. Our hope is to promote the continuing research of diverse targets affecting AD and promote diverse targeting as a near-future strategy.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is a leading causative agent in the defective sperm function associated with male infertility. Such stress commonly manifests via the accumulation of pathological levels of the electrophilic aldehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), generated as a result of lipid peroxidation. This highly reactive lipid aldehyde elicits a spectrum of cytotoxic lesions owing to its propensity to form stable adducts with biomolecules. Notably however, not all elements of the sperm proteome appear to display an equivalent vulnerability to 4HNE modification, with only a small number of putative targets having been identified to date. Here, we validate one such target of 4HNE adduction, A-Kinase Anchor Protein 4 (AKAP4); a major component of the sperm fibrous sheath responsible for regulating the signal transduction and metabolic pathways that support sperm motility and capacitation. Our data confirm that both the precursor (proAKAP4), and mature form of AKAP4, are conserved targets of 4HNE adduction in primary cultures of post-meiotic male germ cells (round spermatids) and in mature mouse and human spermatozoa. We further demonstrate that 4HNE treatment of round spermatids and mature spermatozoa results in a substantial reduction in the levels of both proAKAP4 and AKAP4 proteins. This response proved refractory to pharmacological inhibition of proteolysis, but coincided with an apparent increase in the degree of protein aggregation. Further, we demonstrate that 4HNE-mediated protein degradation and/or aggregation culminates in reduced levels of capacitation-associated phosphorylation in mature human spermatozoa, possibly due to dysregulation of the signaling framework assembled around the AKAP4 scaffold. Together, these findings suggest that AKAP4 plays an important role in the pathophysiological responses to 4HNE, thus strengthening the importance of AKAP4 as a biomarker of sperm quality, and providing the impetus for the design of an efficacious antioxidant-based intervention strategy to alleviate sperm dysfunction.},

Two compounds were synthesized and evaluated. The most promising hybrid molecule reduces both the amyloid pathology and the Tau pathology as well as the memory impairments in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro also, the compound reduces the phosphorylation of Tau and inhibits the release of Aβ peptides while preserving the processing of other metabolites of the amyloid precursor protein. We synthetized and tested the first drug capable of ameliorating both the amyloid and Tau pathology in animal models of AD as well as preventing the major brain lesions and associated memory impairments.

The consequence of the clustering is a reduction in the amount of α3-NKA and an increase in the amount of GluA2-AMPA receptor at synapses. Furthermore, fibrillar Tau destabilizes functional NKA complexes. Tau and α-synuclein aggregates often co-exist in patients' brains. We now show evidences for cross-talk between these pathogenic aggregates with α-synuclein fibrils dramatically enhancing fibrillar Tau clustering and synaptic localization.

METHODS: The PREV-DEMALS (Predict to Prevent Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. Sixty-seven participants (38 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and 29 non-carriers (C9-)) were included in the present cross-sectional study. Each participant underwent one single-shell, multishell diffusion MRI and three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. Volumetric measures, DTI and NODDI metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Differences in white matter integrity, grey matter volume and free water fraction between C9+ and C9- individuals were assessed using linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Compared with C9-, C9+ demonstrated white matter abnormalities in 10 tracts with neurite density index and only 5 tracts with DTI metrics. Effect size was significantly higher for the neurite density index than for DTI metrics in two tracts. No tract had a significantly higher effect size for DTI than for NODDI. For grey matter cortical analysis, free water fraction was increased in 13 regions in C9+, whereas 11 regions displayed volumetric atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: NODDI provides higher sensitivity and greater tissue specificity compared with conventional DTI for identifying white matter abnormalities in the presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. Our results encourage the use of neurite density as a biomarker of the preclinical phase.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-β pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models.
RESULTS: Amyloid-β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86\%) than in nfvPPA (20\%) or svPPA (16\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-β positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10\% at age 50 years to 27\% at age 80 years, p {\textless} 0.01) and svPPA (from 6\% at age 50 years to 32\% at age 80 years, p {\textless} 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often amyloid-β positive (58.0\%) than noncarriers (35.0\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76\%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in svPPA (80\%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64\%).
INTERPRETATION: This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid-β biomarkers in PPA patients.

Mutated hungtingtin, although widely expressed in the brain, predominantly affects striato-pallidal neurons, particularly enriched with adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR), suggesting a possible involvement of adenosine and A2AR is the pathogenesis of HD. In fact, polymorphic variation in the ADORA2A gene influences the age at onset in HD, and A2AR dynamics is altered by mutated huntingtin. Basal levels of adenosine and adenosine receptors are involved in many processes critical for neuronal function and homeostasis, including modulation of synaptic activity and excitotoxicity, the control of neurotrophin levels and functions, and the regulation of protein degradation mechanisms. In the present review, we critically analyze the current literature involving the effect of altered adenosine tone and adenosine receptors in HD and discuss why therapeutics that modulate the adenosine system may represent a novel approach for the treatment of HD.},

The objective of the study was to assess plasma levels of Aβ42 and Aβ40 in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), nonamnestic MCI, and AD patients and to investigate relationships between peripheral and central biomarkers.
METHODS: One thousand forty participants (417 amnestic MCI, 122 nonamnestic MCI, and 501 AD) from the Biomarker of AmyLoïd pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk multicenter prospective study with cognition, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging assessments were included.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 were lower in AD (36.9 [11.7] and 263 [80] pg/mL) than in amnestic MCI (38.2 [11.9] and 269 [68] pg/mL) than in nonamnestic MCI (39.7 [10.5] and 272 [52] pg/mL), respectively (P = .01 for overall difference between groups for Aβ1-42 and P = .04 for Aβ1-40). Globally, plasma Aβ1-42 correlated with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE ε4 allele. Plasma Aβ1-42 correlated with all CSF biomarkers in MCI but only with CSF Aβ42 in AD.
DISCUSSION: Plasma Aβ was associated with cognitive status and CSF biomarkers, suggesting the interest of plasma amyloid biomarkers for diagnosis purpose.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia (60-80\% of cases). In 2016, nearly 44 million people were affected by AD or related dementia. AD is characterized by progressive neuronal damages leading to subtle and latter obvious decline in cognitive functions including symptoms such as memory loss or confusion, which ultimately require full-time medical care. Its neuropathology is defined by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into amyloid plaques, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein. The latter, identified also as Tau pathology, is observed in a broad spectrum of neurological diseases commonly referred to as "Tauopathies". Besides these lesions, sustained neuroinflammatory processes occur, involving notably micro- and astro-glial activation, which contribute to disease progression. Recent findings from genome wide association studies further support an instrumental role of neuroinflammation. While the interconnections existing between this innate immune response and the amyloid pathogenesis are widely characterized and described as complex, elaborated and evolving, only few studies focused on Tau pathology. An adaptive immune response takes place conjointly during the disease course, as indicated by the presence of vascular and parenchymal T-cell in AD patients' brain. The underlying mechanisms of this infiltration and its consequences with regards to Tau pathology remain understudied so far. In the present review, we highlight the interplays existing between Tau pathology and the innate/adaptive immune responses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite diverging levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and TAU pathology, different mouse models, as well as sporadic AD patients show predictable patterns of episodic memory loss. MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation is well established in AD brain but it is unclear whether Aβ or TAU pathology drives those alterations and whether miRNA changes contribute to cognitive decline.
METHODS: miRNAseq was performed on cognitively intact (4 months) and impaired (10 months) male APPtg (APPswe/PS1L166P) and TAUtg (THY-Tau22) mice and their wild-type littermates (APPwt and TAUwt). We analyzed the hippocampi of 12 mice per experimental group (n = 96 in total), and employed a 2-way linear model to extract differentially expressed miRNAs. Results were confirmed by qPCR in a separate cohort of 4 M and 10 M APPtg and APPwt mice (n = 7-9 per group) and in human sporadic AD and non-demented control brain. Fluorescent in situ hybridization identified their cellular expression. Functional annotation of predicted targets was performed using GO enrichment. Behavior of wild-type mice was assessed after intracerebroventricular infusion of miRNA mimics.
RESULTS: Six miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, miR-142a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-211-5p, miR-455-5p) are commonly upregulated between APPtg and TAUtg mice, and four of these (miR-142a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-455-5p) are altered in AD patients. All 6 miRNAs are strongly enriched in neurons. Upregulating these miRNAs in wild-type mice is however not causing AD-related cognitive disturbances.
CONCLUSION: Diverging AD-related neuropathologies induce common disturbances in the expression of neuronal miRNAs. 4 of these miRNAs are also upregulated in AD patients. Therefore these 4 miRNAs (miR-142a-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-455-5p) appear part of a core pathological process in AD patients and APPtg and TAUtg mice. They are however not causing cognitive disturbances in wild-type mice. As some of these miRNA target AD relevant proteins, they may be, in contrast, part of a protective response in AD.},

	abstract = {Alternative promoter usage is an important mechanism for transcriptome diversity and the regulation of gene expression. Indeed, this alternative usage may influence tissue/subcellular specificity, protein translation and function of the proteins. The existence of an alternative promoter for MAPT gene was considered for a long time to explain differential tissue specificity and differential response to transcription and growth factors between mRNA transcripts. The alternative promoter usage could explain partly the different tau proteins expression patterns observed in tauopathies. Here, we report on our discovery of a functional alternative promoter for MAPT, located upstream of the gene's second exon (exon 1). By analyzing genome databases and brain tissue from control individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, we identified novel shorter transcripts derived from this alternative promoter. These transcripts are increased in patients' brain tissue as assessed by 5'RACE-PCR and qPCR. We suggest that these new MAPT isoforms can be translated into normal or amino-terminal-truncated tau proteins. We further suggest that activation of MAPT's alternative promoter under pathological conditions leads to the production of truncated proteins, changes in protein localization and function, and thus neurodegeneration.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the combined presence of amyloid plaques and tau pathology, the latter being correlated with the progression of clinical symptoms. Neuroinflammatory changes are thought to be major contributors to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, even if their precise role still remains largely debated. Notably, to what extent immune responses contribute to cognitive impairments promoted by tau pathology remains poorly understood. To address this question, we took advantage of the THY-Tau22 mouse model that progressively develops hippocampal tau pathology paralleling cognitive deficits and reappraised the interrelationship between tau pathology and brain immune responses. In addition to conventional astroglial and microglial responses, we identified a CD8-positive T cell infiltration in the hippocampus of tau transgenic mice associated with an early chemokine response, notably involving CCL3. Interestingly, CD8-positive lymphocyte infiltration was also observed in the cortex of patients exhibiting frontemporal dementia with P301L tau mutation. To gain insights into the functional involvement of T cell infiltration in the pathophysiological development of tauopathy in THY-Tau22 mice, we chronically depleted T cells using anti-CD3 antibody. Such anti-CD3 treatment prevented hippocampal T cell infiltration in tau transgenic animals and reverted spatial memory deficits, in absence of tau pathology modulation. Altogether, these data support an instrumental role of hippocampal T cell infiltration in tau-driven pathophysiology and cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics alterations are two major hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysfunctional mitochondria accumulate in Alzheimer's disease-affected brains by yet unexplained mechanisms.
METHODS: We combined cell biology, molecular biology, and pharmacological approaches to unravel a novel molecular pathway by which presenilins control phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (Pink-1) expression and transcription. In vivo approaches were carried out on various transgenic and knockout animals as well as in adeno-associated virus-infected mice. Functional readout and mitochondrial physiology (mitochondrial potential) were assessed by combined procedures including flow cytometry, live imaging analysis, and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We show that presenilins 1 and 2 trigger opposite effects on promoter transactivation, messenger RNA, and protein expression of Pink-1. This control is linked to γ-secretase activity and β-amyloid precursor protein but is independent of phosphatase and tensin homolog. We show that amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) accounts for presenilin-dependent phenotype and upregulates Pink-1 transactivation in cells as well as in vivo in a Forkhead box O3a-dependent manner. Interestingly, the modulation of γ-secretase activity or AICD expression affects Pink-1-related control of mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. Finally, we show that parkin acts upstream of presenilins to control Pink-1 promoter transactivation and protein expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we delineate a molecular cascade presenilins-AICD-Forkhead box O3a linking parkin to Pink-1. Our study demonstrates AICD-mediated Pink-1-dependent control of mitochondrial physiology by presenilins. Furthermore, it unravels a parkin-Pink-1 feedback loop controlling mitochondrial physiology that could be disrupted in neurodegenerative conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective neurorestorative therapies of neurodegenerative diseases must be developed. There is increasing interest in using human platelet lysates, rich in neurotrophic factors, as novel disease-modifying strategy of neurodegeneration. To ensure virus safety, pathogen reduction treatments should be incorporated in the preparation process of the platelet concentrates used as source material. We therefore investigated whether platelet concentrates (PC) pathogen-inactivated using a licensed photo-inactivation treatment combining photosensitive psoralen (amotosalen) and UVA irradiation (Intercept) can serve as source material to prepare platelet lysates with preserved neuroprotective activity in Parkinson's disease models.
METHODS: Intercept treated-PCs were centrifuged, when reaching expiry day (7 days after collection), to remove plasma and platelet additive solution. The platelet pellet was re-suspended and concentrated in phosphate buffer saline, subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles (- 80 °C/37 °C) then centrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatant was recovered and further purified, or not, by heat-treatment as in our previous investigations. The content in proteins and neurotrophic factors was determined and the toxicity and neuroprotective activity of the platelet lysates towards LUHMES cells or primary cortical/hippocampal neurons were assessed using ELISA, flow cytometry, cell viability and cytotoxicity assays and proteins analysis by Western blot.
RESULTS: Platelet lysates contained the expected level of total proteins (ca. 7-14 mg/mL) and neurotrophic factors. Virally inactivated and heat-treated platelet lysates did not exert detectable toxic effects on neither Lund human mesencephalic dopaminergic LUHMES cell line nor primary neurons. When used at doses of 5 and 0.5\%, they enhanced the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuron-specific enolase in LUHMES cells and did not significantly impact synaptic protein expression in primary neurons, respectively. Furthermore, virally-inactivated platelet lysates tested were found to exert very strong neuroprotection effects on both LUHMES and primary neurons exposed to erastin, an inducer of ferroptosis cell death.
CONCLUSION: Outdated Intercept pathogen-reduced platelet concentrates can be used to prepare safe and highly neuroprotective human heat-treated platelet pellet lysates. These data open reassuring perspectives in the possibility to develop an effective biotherapy using virally-inactivated platelet lysates rich in functional neurotrophins for neuroregenerative medicine, and for further bio-industrial development. However, the data should be confirmed in animal models.},

To address this question we used human brain samples and 5XFAD mice, an amyloid mouse model of AD expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin1. In the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice and in human AD patients' cortex and hippocampus, Pyk2 total levels were normal. However, Pyk2 Tyr-402 phosphorylation levels, reflecting its autophosphorylation-dependent activity, were reduced in 5XFAD mice at 8 months of age but not 3 months. We crossed these mice with Pyk2-/- mice to generate 5XFAD animals devoid of Pyk2. At 8 months the phenotype of 5XFAD x Pyk2-/- double mutant mice was not different from that of 5XFAD. In contrast, overexpression of Pyk2 in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, using adeno-associated virus, rescued autophosphorylated Pyk2 levels and improved synaptic markers and performance in several behavioral tasks. Both Pyk2-/- and 5XFAD mice showed an increase of potentially neurotoxic Src cleavage product, which was rescued by Pyk2 overexpression. Manipulating Pyk2 levels had only minor effects on Aβ plaques, which were slightly decreased in hippocampus CA3 region of double mutant mice and increased following overexpression. Our results show that Pyk2 is not essential for the pathogenic effects of human amyloidogenic mutations in the 5XFAD mouse model. However, the slight decrease in plaque number observed in these mice in the absence of Pyk2 and their increase following Pyk2 overexpression suggest a contribution of this kinase in plaque formation. Importantly, a decreased function of Pyk2 was observed in 5XFAD mice, indicated by its decreased autophosphorylation and associated Src alterations. Overcoming this deficit by Pyk2 overexpression improved the behavioral and molecular phenotype of 5XFAD mice. Thus, our results in a mouse model of AD suggest that Pyk2 impairment may play a role in the symptoms of the disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss that leads to the development of cognitive deficits. Synapses are neuronal structures that play a crucial role in memory formation and are known to consume most of the energy used in the brain. Interestingly, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the main intracellular energy sensor, is hyper-activated in degenerating neurons in several neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. In this context, we asked whether AMPK hyper-activation could influence synapses' integrity and function. AMPK hyper-activation in differentiated primary neurons led to a time-dependent decrease in pre- and post-synaptic markers, which was accompanied by a reduction in synapses number and a loss of neuronal networks functionality. The loss of post-synaptic proteins was mediated by an AMPK-regulated autophagy-dependent pathway. Finally, this process was also observed in vivo, where AMPK hyper-activation primed synaptic loss. Overall, our data demonstrate that during energetic stress condition, AMPK might play a fundamental role in the maintenance of synaptic integrity, at least in part through the regulation of autophagy. Thus, AMPK might represent a potential link between energetic failure and synaptic integrity in neurodegenerative conditions such as AD.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropathological changes such as Tau lesions and amyloid plaques, but also associated with non-cognitive symptomatology. Metabolic and neuroendocrine abnormalities, such as alterations in body weight, brain insulin impairments, and lower brain glucose metabolism, which often precede clinical diagnosis, have been extensively reported in AD patients. However, the origin of these symptoms and their relation to pathology and cognitive impairments remain misunderstood. Insulin is a hormone involved in the control of energy homeostasis both peripherally and centrally, and insulin-resistant state has been linked to increased risk of dementia. It is now well established that insulin resistance can exacerbate Tau lesions, mainly by disrupting the balance between Tau kinases and phosphatases. On the other hand, the emerging literature indicates that Tau protein can also modulate insulin signalling in the brain, thus creating a detrimental vicious circle. The following review will highlight our current understanding of the role of insulin in the brain and its relation to Tau protein in the context of AD and tauopathies. Considering that insulin signalling is prone to be pharmacologically targeted at multiple levels, it constitutes an appealing approach to improve both insulin brain sensitivity and mitigate brain pathology with expected positive outcome in terms of cognition.},

	abstract = {A recent genome-wide association meta-analysis for Alzheimer's disease (AD) identified 19 risk loci (in addition to APOE) in which the functional genes are unknown. Using Drosophila, we screened 296 constructs targeting orthologs of 54 candidate risk genes within these loci for their ability to modify Tau neurotoxicity by quantifying the size of {\textgreater}6000 eyes. Besides Drosophila Amph (ortholog of BIN1), which we previously implicated in Tau pathology, we identified p130CAS (CASS4), Eph (EPHA1), Fak (PTK2B) and Rab3-GEF (MADD) as Tau toxicity modulators. Of these, the focal adhesion kinase Fak behaved as a strong Tau toxicity suppressor in both the eye and an independent focal adhesion-related wing blister assay. Accordingly, the human Tau and PTK2B proteins biochemically interacted in vitro and PTK2B co-localized with hyperphosphorylated and oligomeric Tau in progressive pathological stages in the brains of AD patients and transgenic Tau mice. These data indicate that PTK2B acts as an early marker and in vivo modulator of Tau toxicity.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of stress granules (SGs) and their resident proteins contributes to pathogenesis of a number of (neuro)degenerative diseases. Phosphorylation of eIF2α is an event integrating different types of cellular stress and it is required for SG assembly. Phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α) is upregulated in the nervous system in some neurodegenerative conditions. We found that increasing p-eIF2α level by proteasomal inhibition in cultured cells, including mouse and human neurons, before a SG-inducing stress ('stress preconditioning'), limits their ability to maintain SG assembly. This is due to upregulation of PP1 phosphatase regulatory subunits GADD34 and/or CReP in preconditioned cells and early decline of p-eIF2α levels during subsequent acute stress. In two model systems with constitutively upregulated p-eIF2α, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking CReP and brain neurons of tau transgenic mice, SG formation was also impaired. Thus, neurons enduring chronic stress or primed by a transient mild stress fail to maintain p-eIF2α levels following subsequent acute stress, which would compromise protective function of SGs. Our findings provide experimental evidence on possible loss of function for SGs in certain neurodegenerative diseases.},

	volume = {6},
	issn = {2047-2927},
	doi = {10.1111/andr.12524},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A-kinase anchor protein 4 (AKAP4) and its precursor pro-AKAP4 are two major proteins in spermatozoa of rodents and mammals. Although researchers have characterized the AKAP4 expression in various species, the protein's expression in humans has not been described in detail.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to characterize human pro-AKAP4 more precisely (notably the definition of its localization and expression levels in human spermatozoa and testes).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: pro-AKAP4 protein expression levels were assessed by Western blotting. The pro-AKAP4's localization in spermatozoa and testes was determined using immunofluorescence staining and immunogold electron microscopy. Furthermore, pro-AKAP4 protein expression levels were assessed in a series of 77 human semen samples, and associations with semen parameters were evaluated.
RESULTS: Western blotting revealed a 100-kDa band in human sperm protein extracts. The pro-AKAP4 was immunolocalized in the fibrous sheath of the flagellum of ejaculated spermatozoa and in elongated spermatids in human testes. A Western blot analysis of 77 normozoospermic semen samples evidenced striking differences in pro-AKAP4 levels from one to another sample (median [interquartile range] integrated optical density = 305 [49-1038]). No correlations were found for pro-AKAP4 levels on one hand and semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm count, sperm motility, or sperm morphology on the other (p {\textgreater} 0.05 for all). However, pro-AKAP4 levels were positively correlated with motility after density gradient centrifugation of the semen (r = 0.224, p = 0.049).
DISCUSSION: AKAP4 protein might be activated as an alternative pathway to rescue sperm motility. In human spermatozoa, pro-AKAP4 might therefore be a 'reservoir' of mature AKAP4.
CONCLUSION: This study generated new knowledge about pro-AKAP4 in human semen, which may be of interest in the management of male infertility.},
