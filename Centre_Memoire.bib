	abstract = {We examined the effects of a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nilvadipine with anti-inflammatory properties on cognition and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers by baseline Alzheimer's disease (AD) severity. Exploratory analyses were performed on the dataset (n = 497) of a phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial to examine the response to nilvadipine in AD subjects stratified by baseline AD severity into very mild (MMSE ≥ 25), mild (MMSE 20-24) and moderate AD (MMSE {\textless} 20). The outcome measures included total and subscale scores of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive 12 (ADAS-Cog 12), the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) and the AD composite score (ADCOMS). Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers Aβ38, Aβ40, Aβ42, neurofilament light chain (NFL), neurogranin, YKL-40, total tau and P181 tau (ptau) were measured in a subset of samples (n = 55). Regression analyses were adjusted for confounders to specifically examine the influence of nilvadipine and baseline AD severity on cognitive outcomes over 78-weeks. Compared to their respective placebo-controls, nilvadipine-treated, very mild AD subjects showed less decline, whereas moderate AD subjects showed a greater cognitive decline on the ADAS-Cog 12 test and the ADCOMS. A lower decline was observed after nilvadipine treatment for a composite memory trait in very mild AD subjects and a composite language trait in mild AD subjects. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios were increased in mild AD and decreased in moderate AD patients treated with nilvadipine, compared to their respective controls. Among moderate AD subjects, levels of ptau, total tau, neurogranin and YKL-40 increased in subjects treated with nilvadipine compared to placebo. These studies suggest that baseline AD severity influenced the treatment outcome in the NILVAD trial and that future clinical trials of nilvadipine should be restricted to mild and very mild AD patients.

It is therefore essential to take these factors into consideration when translating NPTs to be used in screening for cognitive impairment. Translations into Arabic must respect the principles of linguistic relativity and cultural specificity of the population under study. The objective is to assess feasibility and outcome of translating neuropsychological tests to Arabic. A team of Lebanese professionals selected a battery of screening NPTs. These tests were translated into Arabic and independently back translated by a team of sociolinguists and cultural specialists. The translations were adapted to suit the Lebanese culture. The final NPT translated versions were reached by consensus of an expert panel and tested on a group of independently living community-dwelling elderly. Translated items had to be modified when: (1) terms could not be translated using one word as required by the test; (2) Concepts were foreign to the culture; (3) Translated words carried multiple meanings; (4) Words were rarely used in Lebanon; (5) Sentences did not have an equivalent; and (6) Words had letters pronounced differently by subgroups in Lebanon. Despite all measures to maintain cultural sensitivity in translations, non-linguistic challenges remained. A battery of cognitive screening tests were translated into Arabic and adapted for the Lebanese population. These adaptations allow for a better assessment of cognitive abilities since they reflect the thought patterns of the population. The challenge is to establish local normative data.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the association between gender and control of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
METHODS: The sujets âgés cohort is an observational study whose main objective was to describe the real-life management of elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in France. Nine hundred eighty-three patients with diabetes (517 men and 466 women) were recruited by 213 general practitioners and were followed up prospectively every 6 months for 3 years. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were considered controlled if the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) was ≤7\%, blood pressure was {\textless}140/90 mm Hg and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was ≤100 mg/dL. A1C levels and blood pressure measurements were recorded every 6 months for all patients. LDL cholesterol levels were optionally sampled every year.
RESULTS: Women were older than men (77.3±5.72 vs. 76.1±6.01 years), more likely to be alone, less likely to be smokers/ex-smokers and less likely to have cardiovascular disease at baseline. Mean A1C levels of female patients (6.98\%±1.03\%) did not differ from those of male patients (6.91\%±0.96\%). Mean blood pressure measurements during follow up were not different between male and female patients. In contrast, female patients had significantly higher LDL cholesterol levels than male counterparts (105.2±32.6 vs. 94.9±29.1 mg/dL), regardless of statin therapy.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest no difference in the management of cardiovascular risk factors between elderly female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their male counterparts, except for LDL cholesterol, which is significantly higher in women.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The main aim of the present work was to assess if sex influences the occurrence of major clinical events in elderly people with type 2 diabetes followed up in the primary care.
METHODS: 983 subjects aged ≥65years with type 2 diabetes were included by 213 general practitioners and followed up prospectively for three years. Major clinical events were recorded every six month. The first endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and major vascular events (acute coronary syndrome, non-fatal stroke or transient ischemic attack, or revascularization for peripheral artery disease). The second endpoint was all-cause hospitalization. The occurrence of each endpoint was analyzed in order to estimate the role of sex and determine other predictors of major clinical events.
RESULTS: At baseline, women were older than men but they had a lower prevalence of coexisting diseases (cardiovascular disease and cancer) and equivalent diabetes control (Glycated hemoglobin A1C: 6.9\%±0.9 vs. 7.0\%±1.1). Over the follow-up period, women were at lower risk to develop the composite endpoint (HR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.40-0.91, p=0.016) and the hospitalization endpoint (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.52-0.96, p=0.029). Coexisting diseases, functional ability and concomitant medications emerged as significant predictors of both endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly women with well-controlled type 2 diabetes were less likely to experience major clinical events than their male counterparts. More studies are needed to determine the reasons for the higher hospitalization rate in men.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although non-drug interventions are widely used in patients with Alzheimer's disease, few large scale randomized trials involving a long-term intervention and several cognitive-oriented approaches have been carried out. ETNA3 trial compares the effect of cognitive training, reminiscence therapy, and an individualized cognitive rehabilitation program in Alzheimer's disease to usual care.
METHODS: This is a multicenter (40 French clinical sites) randomized, parallel-group trial, with a two-year follow-up comparing groups receiving standardized programs of cognitive training (group sessions), reminiscence therapy (group sessions), individualized cognitive rehabilitation program (individual sessions), and usual care (reference group). Six hundred fifty-three outpatients with Alzheimer's disease were recruited. The primary efficacy outcome was the rate of survival without moderately severe to severe dementia at two years. Secondary outcomes were cognitive impairment, functional disability, behavioral disturbance, apathy, quality of life, depression, caregiver's burden, and resource utilization.
RESULTS: No impact on the primary efficacy measure was evidenced. For the two group interventions (i.e. cognitive training and reminiscence), none of the secondary outcomes differed from usual care. The larger effect was seen with individualized cognitive rehabilitation in which significantly lower functional disability and a six-month delay in institutionalization at two years were evidenced.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge current management practices of Alzheimer's patients. While cognitive-oriented group therapies have gained popularity, this trial does not show improvement for the patients. The individualized cognitive rehabilitation intervention provided clinically significant results. Individual interventions should be considered to delay institutionalization in Alzheimer's disease.},

Multivariate logistic regression analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, physical, mental health variables, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E ε4). Elderly women taking inhaled corticosteroids were at increased risk for cognitive decline over 7 years in executive functioning (odds ratio, 1.76; 95\% confidence interval, 1.14-2.71; p = 0.04); the effect being increased after continuous use (odds ratio, 3.15; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29-7.68; p = 0.01) and not found after discontinuation of treatment. In men, no significant associations were observed. Corticosteroid use was not significantly associated with an increase risk of incident dementia over 7 years. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was not significantly associated with either dementia incidence or cognitive decline in both sexes. The association may be related to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal corticotropic axis dysfunctioning rather than a direct anti-inflammatory mechanism. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may constitute a form of reversible cognitive disorder in elderly women. Physicians should check this possibility before assuming neurodegenerative changes.},

Previous studies suggest that SYNJ1 polymorphisms have significant impact on the age of onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that SYNJ1 is involved in amyloid-induced toxicity. Yet SYNJ1 protein level and cellular localization in post-mortem human AD brain tissues have remained elusive. This study aimed to examine whether SYNJ1 localization and expression are altered in post-mortem AD brains. We found that SYNJ1 is accumulated in Hirano bodies, plaque-associated dystrophic neurites and some neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). SYNJ1 immunoreactivity was higher in neurons and in the senile plaques in AD patients carrying one or two ApolipoproteinE (APOE) ε4 allele(s). In two large cohorts of APOE-genotyped controls and AD patients, SYNJ1 transcripts were significantly increased in AD temporal isocortex compared to control. There was a significant increase in SYNJ1 transcript in APOEε4 carriers compared to non-carriers in AD cohort. SYNJ1 was systematically co-enriched with PHF-tau in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction of AD brain. In the RIPA-insoluble fraction containing protein aggregates, SYNJ1 proteins were significantly increased and observed as a smear containing full-length and cleaved fragments in AD brains. In vitro cleavage assay showed that SYNJ1 is a substrate of calpain, which is highly activated in AD brains. Our study provides evidence of alterations in SYNJ1 mRNA level and SYNJ1 protein degradation, solubility and localization in AD brains.},

	abstract = {Objective: To quantify the effect of genetic factors and generations influencing the age at onset (AAO) in families with frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTD) due to C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions and GRN mutations.
Methods: We studied 504 affected individuals from 133 families with C9ORF72 repeat expansions and 90 FTD families with mutations in GRN, 2 major genes responsible for FTD and/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Intrafamilial correlations of AAO were analyzed, and variance component methods were used for heritability estimates. Generational effects on hazard rates for AAO were assessed using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard models.
Results: A generational effect influencing AAO was detected in both C9ORF72 and GRN families. Nevertheless, the estimated proportion of AAO variance explained by genetic factors was high in FTD caused by C9ORF72 repeat expansions (44\%; p = 1.10e-4), 62\% when the AAO of dementia was specifically taken into account (p = 8.10e-5), and to a lesser degree in GRN families (26\%; p = 0.17). Intrafamilial correlation analyses revealed a significant level of correlations in C9ORF72 families according to the degree of kinship. A pattern of intrafamilial correlations also suggested potential X-linked modifiers acting on AAO. Nonsignificant correlation values were observed in GRN families.
Conclusions: Our results provide original evidence that genetic modifiers strongly influence the AAO in C9ORF72 carriers, while their effects seem to be weaker in GRN families. This constitutes a rational to search for genetic biomarkers, which could help to improve genetic counseling, patient care, and monitoring of therapeutic trials.},

The objective was to describe the relationship between cardiovascular drugs and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in elderly individuals in the real-life setting. This is an ancillary study of the prospective non-interventional S.AGE (aged individuals) cohort. General physicians were free to prescribe any drug their patients needed. The participants were non-institutionalized patients aged 65 years and older treated by their primary physician for either chronic pain or atrial fibrillation or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) derived from the CKD-EPI formula was determined at inclusion and every year during 2 years of follow-up. This study comprised 2505 patients aged 77.8 ± 6.2 years. At inclusion, the factors associated with CKD (eGFR {\textless} 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ) in multivariate analysis were age, female gender, hypertension, heart failure, history of atherothrombotic disease and renin angiotensin system blockers, loop diuretics and calcium channel inhibitors. Introduction of each of these three drug classes during the follow-up period led to only a small decrease in the eGFR: -3.8 ± 12.7 (p {\textless} 0.0006), -2.2 ± 12.0 (p {\textless} 0.003) and -1.0 ± 13.4 ml/min./1.73 m(2) (NS), respectively. Only the introduction of loop diuretics was associated with CKD (OR 1.91, 95\% CI: 1.25-2.90; p = 0.002).

	abstract = {Adaptation of drug dosage to kidney function is a common problem in general practice. The aim was to describe adaptation of cardiovascular drugs and metformin according to renal function and its association with mortality with regard to metformin in a cohort of elderly patients. This was an ancillary study to the S.AGES cohort made up of patients over 65 years of age managed by their general practitioner under real-life conditions and followed up prospectively for 3 years. The medications studied were digoxin, spironolactone and metformin. Adaptation of their daily dose according to renal function (eGFR according to CKD/EPI) was compared to that recommended in the summaries of product characteristics (SPCs) or international scientific societies (ISS). A total of 900 patients were included, including 588 on metformin. At baseline, dose adjustment according to renal function was 100\% and 87.6\% (95\% CI: 82.6-92.6) for patients on digoxin and spironolactone respectively. For metformin, only 71.3\% (95\% CI: 67.6-74.9) or 78.1\% (95\% CI: 74.7-81.4) of patients had their dosage adapted at inclusion according to their renal function depending on whether the SPCs or ISS recommendations were considered. During the 3-year follow-up period, 42/588 patients died (none from lactic acidosis). At inclusion, a metformin dosage not adapted for renal function according to ISS was not associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (OR 1.7; 95\% CI 0.6-5.0, p = 0.32). In conclusion, approximately one-quarter of elderly patients treated with metformin do not have their dosage adapted for renal function according to ISS although there is no increase in mortality after follow-up for 3 years.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a cohort of non-institutionalised elderly patients with chronic pain recruited by general practitioners, we selected patients who were treated with DXP daily for at least 6 months just prior to DXP market withdrawal and who had an evaluation of pain and its impact on daily activities before and after DXP withdrawal.
RESULTS: One hundred three patients took DXP daily for chronic pain. Immediately after DXP market withdrawal, 42 (40.8\%), 55 (53.4\%) and 3 (2.9\%) patients were treated with step 1, 2 and 3 analgesics, respectively, and 3 patients (2.9\%) were no longer receiving any analgesic medication. Among the 55 patients who continued on step 2 analgesics, 37 were treated with tramadol, 14 with codeine and 9 with opium. Pain intensity and the impact of pain on daily activities remained stable.

	abstract = {Importance: Behavioral disturbances are core features of frontotemporal dementia (FTD); however, symptom progression across the course of disease is not well characterized in genetic FTD.
Objective: To investigate behavioral symptom frequency and severity and their evolution and progression in different forms of genetic FTD.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study, the international Genetic FTD Initiative (GENFI), was conducted from January 30, 2012, to May 31, 2019, at 23 multicenter specialist tertiary FTD research clinics in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Canada. Participants included a consecutive sample of 232 symptomatic FTD gene variation carriers comprising 115 with variations in C9orf72, 78 in GRN, and 39 in MAPT. A total of 101 carriers had at least 1 follow-up evaluation (for a total of 400 assessments). Gene variations were included only if considered pathogenetic.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed across disease duration and evaluated from symptom onset. Hierarchical generalized linear mixed models were used to model behavioral and neuropsychiatric measures as a function of disease duration and variation.
Results: Of 232 patients with FTD, 115 (49.6\%) had a C9orf72 expansion (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age at evaluation, 64.3 [57.5-69.7] years; 72 men [62.6\%]; 115 White patients [100\%]), 78 (33.6\%) had a GRN variant (median [IQR] age, 63.4 [58.3-68.8] years; 40 women [51.3\%]; 77 White patients [98.7\%]), and 39 (16.8\%) had a MAPT variant (median [IQR] age, 56.3 [49.9-62.4] years; 25 men [64.1\%]; 37 White patients [94.9\%]). All core behavioral symptoms, including disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, perseverative behavior, and hyperorality, were highly expressed in all gene variant carriers ({\textgreater}50\% patients), with apathy being one of the most common and severe symptoms throughout the disease course (51.7\%-100\% of patients). Patients with MAPT variants showed the highest frequency and severity of most behavioral symptoms, particularly disinhibition (79.3\%-100\% of patients) and compulsive behavior (64.3\%-100\% of patients), compared with C9orf72 carriers (51.7\%-95.8\% of patients with disinhibition and 34.5\%-75.0\% with compulsive behavior) and GRN carriers (38.2\%-100\% with disinhibition and 20.6\%-100\% with compulsive behavior). Alongside behavioral symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms were very frequently reported in patients with genetic FTD: anxiety and depression were most common in GRN carriers (23.8\%-100\% of patients) and MAPT carriers (26.1\%-77.8\% of patients); hallucinations, particularly auditory and visual, were most common in C9orf72 carriers (10.3\%-54.5\% of patients). Most behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms increased in the early-intermediate phases and plateaued in the late stages of disease, except for depression, which steadily declined in C9orf72 carriers, and depression and anxiety, which surged only in the late stages in GRN carriers.
Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that behavioral and neuropsychiatric disturbances differ between the common FTD gene variants and have different trajectories throughout the course of disease. These findings have crucial implications for counseling patients and caregivers and for the design of disease-modifying treatment trials in genetic FTD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-β pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models.
RESULTS: Amyloid-β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86\%) than in nfvPPA (20\%) or svPPA (16\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-β positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10\% at age 50 years to 27\% at age 80 years, p {\textless} 0.01) and svPPA (from 6\% at age 50 years to 32\% at age 80 years, p {\textless} 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often amyloid-β positive (58.0\%) than noncarriers (35.0\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76\%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in svPPA (80\%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64\%).
INTERPRETATION: This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid-β biomarkers in PPA patients.

Male C57Bl6/J mice were stereotactically administered collagenase to induce cortical lesion analysed by MRI at 24 h.

Brain metabolism was impaired in all cortex, striatum and the ipsilateral dentate gyrus. A significant improvement in cognition performances was depicted under atorvastatin. In this novel murine model of CMBs, we validated that CMBs lowered cognitive performances and affected regional metabolism.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The most recent theories of emotions have postulated that their expression and recognition depend on acquired conceptual knowledge. In other words, the conceptual knowledge derived from prior experiences guide our ability to make sense of such emotions. However, clear evidence is still lacking to contradict more traditional theories, considering emotions as innate, distinct and universal physiological states. In addition, whether valence processing (i.e. recognition of the pleasant/unpleasant character of emotions) also relies on semantic knowledge is yet to be determined. To investigate the contribution of semantic knowledge to facial emotion recognition and valence processing, we conducted a behavioural and neuroimaging study in 20 controls and 16 patients with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease that is prototypical of semantic memory impairment, and in which an emotion recognition deficit has already been described. We assessed participants’ knowledge of emotion concepts and recognition of 10 basic (e.g. anger) or self-conscious (e.g. embarrassment) facial emotional expressions presented both statically (images) and dynamically (videos). All participants also underwent a brain MRI. Group comparisons revealed deficits in both emotion concept knowledge and emotion recognition in patients, independently of type of emotion and presentation. These measures were significantly correlated with each other in patients and with semantic fluency in patients and controls. Neuroimaging analyses showed that both emotion recognition and emotion conceptual knowledge were correlated with reduced grey matter density in similar areas within frontal ventral, temporal, insular and striatal regions, together with white fibre degeneration in tracts connecting frontal regions with each other as well as with temporal regions. We then performed a qualitative analysis of responses made during the facial emotion recognition task, by delineating valence errors (when one emotion was mistaken for another of a different valence), from other errors made during the emotion recognition test. We found that patients made more valence errors. The number of valence errors correlated with emotion conceptual knowledge as well as with reduced grey matter volume in brain regions already retrieved to correlate with this score. Specificity analyses allowed us to conclude that this cognitive relationship and anatomical overlap were not mediated by a general effect of disease severity. Our findings suggest that semantic knowledge guides the recognition of emotions and is also involved in valence processing. Our study supports a constructionist view of emotion recognition and valence processing, and could help to refine current theories on the interweaving of semantic knowledge and emotion processing.},

	abstract = {Importance: Presymptomatic carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutation, the most frequent genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, represent the optimal target population for the development of disease-modifying drugs. Preclinical biomarkers are needed to monitor the effect of therapeutic interventions in this population.
Objectives: To assess the occurrence of cognitive, structural, and microstructural changes in presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers.
Design, Setting, and Participants: The PREV-DEMALS study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. Eighty-four participants entered the study between October 2015 and April 2017; 80 (95\%) were included in cross-sectional analyses of baseline data. All participants underwent neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging; 63 (79\%) underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Gray matter volumes and diffusion tensor imaging metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Anatomical and microstructural differences between individuals who carried the C9orf72 mutation (C9+) and those who did not carry the C9orf72 mutation (C9-) were assessed using linear mixed-effects models. Data were analyzed from October 2015 to April 2017.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Differences in neuropsychological scores, gray matter volume, and white matter integrity between C9+ and C9- individuals.
Results: Of the 80 included participants, there were 41 C9+ individuals (24 [59\%] female; mean [SD] age, 39.8 [11.1] years) and 39 C9- individuals (24 [62\%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.2 [13.9] years). Compared with C9- individuals, C9+ individuals had lower mean (SD) praxis scores (163.4 [6.1] vs 165.3 [5.9]; P = .01) and intransitive gesture scores (34.9 [1.6] vs 35.7 [1.5]; P = .004), atrophy in 8 cortical regions of interest and in the right thalamus, and white matter alterations in 8 tracts. When restricting the analyses to participants younger than 40 years, compared with C9- individuals, C9+ individuals had lower praxis scores and intransitive gesture scores, atrophy in 4 cortical regions of interest and in the right thalamus, and white matter alterations in 2 tracts.
Conclusions and Relevance: Cognitive, structural, and microstructural alterations are detectable in young C9+ individuals. Early and subtle praxis alterations, underpinned by focal atrophy of the left supramarginal gyrus, may represent an early and nonevolving phenotype related to neurodevelopmental effects of C9orf72 mutation. White matter alterations reflect the future phenotype of frontotemporal lobar degeneration/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, while atrophy appears more diffuse. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the preclinical phase of C9orf72 disease and of the respective contribution of magnetic resonance biomarkers.

Mature megakaryocytes are polyploid cells that have arrested DNA replication and cellular proliferation but continue sustained protein synthesis. Here, we show that TPO induces cell-cycle arrest in the megakaryocytic UT7-MPL cell line by the activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway, induction of p21CIP transcription, and senescence markers through EGR1 activation. A similar senescence-like process was also detected in normal primary postmitotic megakaryocytes. In contrast, senescence was not observed in malignant megakaryocytes derived from primary myelofibrosis patients (a form of chronic myeloid hemopathy). Our data indicate that polyploid mature megakaryocytes receive signals from TPO to arrest cell proliferation and enter a senescent-like state. An escape from this physiological process may be associated with certain myeloproliferative neoplasms leading to abnormal megakaryocytic proliferation.},

	abstract = {Megakaryopoiesis is a 2-step differentiation process, regulated by thrombopoietin (TPO), on binding to its cognate receptor myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL). This receptor associates with intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, essentially janus kinase 2 (JAK2), which regulates MPL stability and cell-surface expression, and mediates TPO-induced signal transduction. We demonstrate that JAK2 and MPL mediate TPO-induced proliferation arrest and megakaryocytic differentiation of the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line UT7-MPL. A decrease in JAK2 or MPL protein expression, and JAK2 chemical inhibition, suppress this antiproliferative action of TPO. The expression of JAK2 and MPL, which progressively increases along normal human megakaryopoiesis, is decreased in platelets of patients diagnosed with JAK2- or MPL-mutated essential thrombocytemia and primary myelofibrosis, 2 myeloproliferative neoplasms in which megakaryocytes (MKs) proliferate excessively. Finally, low doses of JAK2 chemical inhibitors are shown to induce a paradoxical increase in MK production, both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that JAK2 and MPL expression levels regulate megakaryocytic proliferation vs differentiation in both normal and pathological conditions, and that JAK2 chemical inhibitors could promote a paradoxical thrombocytosis when used at suboptimal doses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have followed-up on the recent genome-wide association (GWA) of the clusterin gene (CLU) with increased risk for Alzheimer disease (AD), by performing an unbiased resequencing of all CLU coding exons and regulatory regions in an extended Flanders-Belgian cohort of Caucasian AD patients and control individuals (n = 1930). Moreover, we have replicated genetic findings by targeted resequencing in independent Caucasian cohorts of French (n = 2182) and Canadian (n = 573) origin and by performing meta-analysis combining our data with previous genetic CLU screenings.
RESULTS: In the Flanders-Belgian cohort, we identified significant clustering in exons 5-8 of rare genetic variations leading to non-synonymous substitutions and a 9-bp insertion/deletion affecting the CLU β-chain (p = 0.02). Replicating this observation by targeted resequencing of CLU exons 5-8 in 2 independent Caucasian cohorts of French and Canadian origin identified identical as well as novel non-synonymous substitutions and small insertion/deletions. A meta-analysis, combining the datasets of the 3 cohorts with published CLU sequencing data, confirmed that rare coding variations in the CLU β-chain were significantly enriched in AD patients (OR(MH) = 1.96 [95\% CI = 1.18-3.25]; p = 0.009). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis indicated the common AD risk association (GWA SNP rs11136000, p = 0.013) in the 3 combined datasets could not be explained by the presence of the rare coding variations we identified. Further, high-density SNP mapping in the CLU locus mapped the common association signal to a more 5' CLU region.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a new genetic risk association of AD with rare coding CLU variations that is independent of the 5' common association signal identified in the GWA studies. At this stage the role of these coding variations and their likely effect on the β-chain domain and CLU protein functioning remains unclear and requires further studies.},

METHODS: We performed standardized neuropsychological tests and an MRI scan in 170 consecutive MCI patients. Medial temporal lobe atrophy and SH, including periventricular, lobar white matter, basal ganglia and infratentorial hyperintensities, were assessed with visual semiquantitative scales.
RESULTS: The median age was 68.1 years (range: 45.5 to 87.0), and the median Mini-Mental State Examination score 28.0 (range: 26.0 to 30.0). MCI subtypes were amnestic single domain (21.2\%), amnestic multiple domain (52.3\%), nonamnestic single domain (21.8\%), and nonamnestic multiple domain (4.7\%). SH were found in 157 patients (92.6\%); periventricular hyperintensities (80.6\%) and lobar white matter hyperintensities (83.5\%) were the most prominent locations. There was no association between SH and MCI subtypes. Executive dysfunction was independently associated with SH (odds ratio=2.53, 95\% CI: 1.20 to 5.32), periventricular hyperintensities (odds ratio=2.51, 95\% CI: 1.13 to 5.55), and white matter hyperintensities (odds ratio=2.08, 95\% CI: 1.01 to 4.25).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SH is high in MCI patients, irrespective of MCI subtypes. SH (especially periventricular hyperintensities, and lobar white matter hyperintensities) are associated with executive dysfunction.},

Two consecutive cohorts comprising 548 patients in total were recruited by the Memory and Neurology Clinics at Lille University Hospital (France). These included 293 patients with AD, 171 patients with other dementias and 84 healthy controls. All patients underwent lumbar puncture for the assessment of CSF concentrations of Aβ1-42, t-Tau and p-Tau. International criteria for dementias were used for diagnosis by investigators blind to CSF test results. To identify the combination of biomarkers that best predicted the 3 diagnoses, we used the CHAID decision tree method with the first cohort. Our analysis yielded a two-step decision tree, with a first stratification step based on the Aβ1-42/p-Tau ratio of the CSF, and a second step based on CSF p-Tau concentrations. The second cohort was then used to determine the power (0.618), sensitivity (82\%) and specificity (81\%) of this tree in AD diagnosis. These were found to be at least as high as those of other known algorithms based on the three CSF biomarkers, Aβ1-42, t-Tau and p-Tau.For the first time, diagnostic rules for AD based on CSF variables were compared in a single study. Our findings indicate that the measurement of Aβ1-42 and p-Tau levels in the CSF is sufficient to diagnose AD.},

DESIGN: A case report.
SETTING: University memory clinic. Patient A 74-year-old woman with clinical features of probable AD. Intervention The patient received 2 injections of 225 mug of AN-1792 (beta-amyloid [Abeta]) plus 50 mug of the adjuvant QS-21 at an interval of 4 weeks. The patient was an antibody responder with an IgG anti-AN-1792 antibody titer exceeding 10 000 and an IgM titer exceeding 3500. Maximum serum anti-Abeta titers were reached in 4.7 months. During the 3 following years, while the Mini-Mental State Examination score remained globally stable despite several confusional episodes, she developed clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies. The patient died 34 months postimmunization. An autopsy was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neuropathological and biochemical examination of the brain using standardized evaluation for tau, beta-amyloid, and synuclein deposits.
RESULTS: Neither neuropathological nor biochemical examinations showed amyloid deposit in the brain of this immunized patient. For tau deposition, Braak stage was IV/VI, and the Western blot analysis score was 9c/10. The neuropathological semiquantitative score for alpha-synuclein aggregation was 4. There was no inflammation. These results were compared with those of an age-matched patient with AD and a control devoid of any neurological disease.
CONCLUSION: In this Lewy body variant case, with globally stable functional and cognitive features, Abeta immunization resulted in a significant clearance of amyloid deposits, with remaining tau and synuclein pathological features in the brain. Patients with a Lewy body variant of AD should not be excluded from enrollment in Abeta-immunization trials.},

No consensus currently exists on the best possible design of Phase II studies to inform the Go/Nogo decision optimally. The challenges in choosing the best study design relate to the target population, the end-point criteria used, in particular the use of biomarkers, the experimental protocol, and the study duration.

	abstract = {The pathomechanisms that associate a deficit in folate and/or vitamin B12 and the subsequent hyperhomocysteinemia with pathological brain ageing are unclear. We investigated the homocysteinylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, and in rats depleted in folate and vitamin B12, Cd320 KO mice with selective B12 brain deficiency and H19-7 neuroprogenitors lacking folate. Compared with controls, N-homocysteinylated tau and MAP1 were increased and accumulated in protein aggregates and tangles in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of patients and animals. N-homocysteinylation dissociated tau and MAPs from β-tubulin, and MS analysis showed that it targets lysine residues critical for their binding to β-tubulin. N-homocysteinylation increased in rats exposed to vitamin B12 and folate deficit during gestation and lactation and remained significantly higher when they became 450 days-old, despite returning to normal diet at weaning, compared with controls. It was correlated with plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and brain expression of methionine tRNAsynthetase (MARS), the enzyme required for the synthesis of Hcy-thiolactone, the substrate of N-homocysteinylation. Experimental inactivation of MARS prevented the N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1, and the dissociation of tau and MAP1 from β-tubulin and PSD95 in cultured neuroprogenitors. In conclusion, increased N-homocysteinylation of tau and MAP1 is a mechanism of brain ageing that depends on Hcy concentration and expression of MARS enzyme. Its irreversibility and cumulative occurrence throughout life may explain why B12 and folate supplementation of the elderly has limited effects, if any, to prevent pathological brain ageing and cognitive decline.

It has been suggested that the anatomical pathway likely used to initiate rapid oculomotor responses in the saccadic choice task could involve the Frontal Eye Field, a structure that is part of the dorsal attentional network, in which connectivity is disrupted in AD. Seventeen patients with mild AD and 23 healthy age-matched controls took part in the study. A group of 24 young healthy observers was included as it has been reported that normal aging affects eye movements. Participants were presented with pairs of colored photographs of natural scenes, one containing an animal (the target) and one containing various objects (distracter), displayed for 1 s left and right of fixation. They were asked to saccade to the scene containing an animal. Neither pathology nor age affected temporal (saccade latencies and durations) and spatial (saccade amplitude) parameters of eye movements. Patients with AD were significantly less accurate than age-matched controls, and older participants were less accurate than young observers. The results are interpreted in terms of noisier sensory information and increased uncertainty in relation to deficits in the magnocellular pathway. The results suggest that, even at a mild stage of the pathology, people exhibit difficulties in selecting relevant objects.},

Here, we assessed the ability to find a target object within a natural scene in people with AD and in people with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, a variant of AD). Pairs of color photographs were displayed on the left and right of a fixation cross for 1 s. In separate blocks of trials, participants were asked to categorize the target (an animal) by either moving their eyes toward the photograph containing the target (the saccadic choice task) or pressing a key corresponding to the target's location (the manual choice task). Isolated objects and objects within scenes were studied in both tasks. Participants with PCA were more impaired in detection of a target within a scene than participants with AD. The latter's performance pattern was more similar to that of age-matched controls in terms of accuracy, saccade latencies and the benefit gained from contextual information. Participants with PCA benefited less from contextual information in both the saccade and the manual choice tasks-suggesting that people with posterior brain lesions have impairments in figure/ground segregation and are more sensitive to object crowding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the association between poststroke cognitive impairment and defining a specific resting functional marker.
METHODS: The resting-state functional connectivity 6 months after an ischemic stroke in 56 patients was investigated. Twenty-nine of the patients who had an impairment of one or several cognitive domains were compared to 27 without any cognitive deficit. We studied the whole-brain connectivity using 2 complementary approaches: graph theory to study the functional network organization and network-based statistics to explore connectivity between brain regions. We assessed the potential cortical atrophy using voxel-based morphometry analysis.
RESULTS: The overall topological organization of the functional network was not altered in cognitively impaired stroke patients, who had the same mean node degree, average clustering coefficient, and global efficiency as cognitively healthy stroke patients. Network-based statistics analysis showed that poststroke cognitive impairment was associated with dysfunction of a whole-brain network composed of 167 regions and 178 connections, and functional disconnections between superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri and the superior and inferior temporal gyri. These regions had connections that were specifically and positively correlated with cognitive domain scores. No intergroup differences in overall gray matter thickness and ischemic infarct topography were observed. To assess the effect of prestroke white matter hyperintensities on connectivity, we included the initial Fazekas scale in the regression model for a second network-based analysis. The resulting network was associated with the same key alterations but had fewer connections.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed functional network alterations suggest that the appearance of a cognitive impairment following stroke may be associated with a particular functional alteration, shared specifically between cognitive domains.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not straightforward, especially in the early stages of disease. We compared AD biomarkers (phospho-Tau181, total-Tau, Aβ42 and Aβ40) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with DLB and AD, focusing especially on the prodromal stage.
METHODS: A total of 1221 CSF were collected in different memory centres (ePLM network) in France and analysed retrospectively. Samples were obtained from patients with prodromal DLB (pro-DLB; n=57), DLB dementia (DLB-d; n=154), prodromal AD (pro-AD; n=132) and AD dementia (n=783), and control subjects (CS; n=95). These centres use the same diagnostic procedure and criteria to evaluate the patients.
RESULTS: In patients with pro-DLB, CSF Aβ42 levels appeared much less disrupted than in patients at the demented stage (DLB-d) (P{\textless}0.05 CS{\textgreater}pro-DLB; P{\textless}0.001 CS{\textgreater}DLB-d). On average, Aβ40 levels in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d) were much below those in patients with pro-AD (P{\textless}0.001 DLB groups{\textless}pro-AD). The Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in patients with pro-DLB remained close to that of CS. t-Tau and phospho-Tau181 levels were unaltered in patients with DLB (pro-DLB and DLB-d).
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced levels of CSF Aβ42 were found in patients with DLB but rather at a later stage, reaching those of patients with AD, in whom Aβ42 levels were decreased even at the prodromal stage. At the prodromal stage of DLB, the majority of patients presented a normal CSF profile. CSF t-Tau and phospho-Tau181 were the best biomarkers to discriminate between AD and DLB, whatever the stage of disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) relies primarily on clinical features and remains challenging. The specificity of the recently revised criteria can be disappointing, justifying development of new clinical tools.
OBJECTIVE: We produced a behavioral inventory named DAPHNE. This scale (adapted from Rascovsky's criteria) explores six domains: disinhibition, apathy, perseverations, hyperorality, personal neglect and loss of empathy. It is composed of ten items (five answer categories). The aim was (1) to assess the validity and reliability of DAPHNE and (2) to evaluate its contribution in differentiating patients.
METHODS: Two scores were computed: DAPHNE-6 (screening) from the six domains and DAPHNE-40 (diagnosis) from the ten items. Reliability and reproducibility were assessed. External validity was studied with the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Frontotemporal Behavioral Scale (FBS). Finally, the diagnostic performance of DAPHNE was compared to revised criteria, FBI and FBS.
RESULTS: DAPHNE was administered to the caregivers of 89 patients, 36 with bvFTD, 22 with Alzheimer's disease, 15 with progressive supranuclear palsy and 16 with bipolar disorder. Reliability and reproducibility were excellent, as was external validity. DAPHNE-6 allowed bvFTD diagnosis (score ≥4) with a sensitivity of 92\%, while DAPHNE-40 (score ≥15) had a specificity of 92\%.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate excellent psychometric features for DAPHNE. This quick tool could help for both diagnosing and screening bvFTD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Converging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with FTD-related disorders-namely, FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-and 1 or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis. We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA, up to 160-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and UC, up to 180-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and T1D, and up to 175-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and CeD. In contrast, for CBD and PSP, only 1 of the 6 immune-mediated diseases produced genetic enrichment comparable to that seen for FTD, with up to 150-fold genetic enrichment between CBD and CeD and up to 180-fold enrichment between PSP and RA. Further, we found minimal enrichment between ALS and the immune-mediated diseases tested, with the highest levels of enrichment between ALS and RA (up to 20-fold). For FTD, at a conjunction false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05 and after excluding SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, we found that 8 of the 15 identified loci mapped to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on Chromosome (Chr) 6. We also found novel candidate FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TBK1 binding protein 1), and PGBD5 (piggyBac transposable element derived 5). Functionally, we found that the expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with FTD and is enriched in microglia/macrophages compared to other central nervous system cell types. The main study limitation is that the results represent only clinically diagnosed individuals. Also, given the complex interconnectedness of the HLA region, we were not able to define the specific gene or genes on Chr 6 responsible for our pleiotropic signal.
CONCLUSIONS: We show immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to FTD risk. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.},

Its objective is to describe the medical management in primary care. This article presents the baseline characteristics of subjects in the diabetes subcohort and compares the results to those from cohorts of older diabetic patients.
METHODS: From April 2009 to June 2011, 983 patients were included in the diabetes subcohort by 213 primary care providers. Demographic data, geriatric parameters and the history, characteristics and treatment of the diabetes were recorded at baseline.
RESULTS: The mean age was 76.7 ± 5.9 years. Most patients were living independently, with no cognitive impairment and in relatively good health. The duration of diabetes was 11.3 ± 8.7 years with average HbA1c of 6.9 ± 1.0\%. 20\% of patients had macrovascular disease, 33\% renal failure, 14.6\% ocular complication and 7.1\% neuropathy. The first-line antidiabetic treatment was metformin (61.2\%) and 18\% of patients had used insulin. Treatment intensified with the worsening of diabetic symptoms. When compared to those from French and North American cohorts, the results showed increased complications and use of insulin with age, disease duration and severity.
CONCLUSION: Due to the method of recruitment, S.AGES patients were generally healthy with well-controlled diabetes. However, the results were consistent with those from other cohorts. Three-year follow-up is expected to study the management of diabetic patients aged 65 and over in primary care.},

	abstract = {Mutations in signaling molecules of the cytokine receptor axis play a central role in myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) pathogenesis. Polycythemia vera is mainly related to JAK2 mutations, whereas a wider mutational spectrum is detected in essential thrombocythemia (ET) with mutations in JAK2, the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (MPL), and the calreticulin (CALR) genes. Here, we studied the mutational profile of 17 ET patients negative for JAK2V617F, MPLW515K/L, and CALR mutations, using whole-exome sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) targeted on JAK2 and MPL. We found several signaling mutations including JAK2V617F at very low allele frequency, 1 homozygous SH2B3 mutation, 1 MPLS505N, 1 MPLW515R, and 2 MPLS204P mutations. In the remaining patients, 4 presented a clonal and 7 a polyclonal hematopoiesis, suggesting that certain triple-negative ETs are not MPNs. NGS on 26 additional triple-negative ETs detected only 1 MPLY591N mutation. Functional studies on MPLS204P and MPLY591N revealed that they are weak gain-of-function mutants increasing MPL signaling and conferring either TPO hypersensitivity or independence to expressing cells, but with a low efficiency. Further studies should be performed to precisely determine the frequency of MPLS204 and MPLY591 mutants in a bigger cohort of MPN.},

In the present study, we generated an original "sporadic tauopathy-like" model in the rat hippocampus, encoding six Tau isoforms as found in humans, using lentiviral vectors (LVs) for the delivery of a human WT Tau. The overexpression of human WT Tau in pyramidal neurons resulted in NFD, the morphological characteristics and kinetics of which reflected the slow and sporadic neurodegenerative processes observed in sporadic tauopathies, unlike the rapid neurodegenerative processes leading to cell death and ghost tangles triggered by the FTDP-17 mutant Tau P301L. This new model highlights differences in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathological processes induced by WT and mutant Tau and suggests that preference should be given to animal models using WT Tau in the quest to understand sporadic tauopathies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe a cluster of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in northern France. PSP has not been reported in geographical, temporal, or occupational clusters. A unit of Neurology and Neurogeriatrics opened in 2005 at the Centre Hospitalier de Wattrelos, serving the population of Wattrelos and Leers (combined population 51,551) and parts of neighboring towns. For most of the 20th century, this area was a center for chromate and phosphate ore processing, textile dyeing, and tanning. Significant industrial waste persists close to residential areas.
METHODS: From 2005 to 2014, 92 patients with PSP at Centre Hospitalier de Wattrelos were identified and studied. Detailed residential data were available in the medical records. Eighty cases have had magnetic resonance head scanning and 60 have died, of whom 13 have been examined neuropathologically.
RESULTS: The ratio of observed to expected PSP incidence over the period 2005 to 2012 was 12.3 (95\% confidence interval: 7.4-35.9). Mean onset age was 74.3 years. The Richardson syndrome/PSP-parkinsonism ratio was 43\%/42\%. Four other phenotypes each occurred in 2\% to 5\%. Onset was gait/balance difficulty in 52\%. None of the 92 affected patients were relatives and 7 were of North African ancestry. MRI was compatible with a clinical diagnostic of PSP in all cases. Histopathologic examination confirmed neurofibrillary degeneration and tufted astrocytes in all autopsied cases. Western blots revealed a typical tau 4R doublet. The tau H1 haplotype occurred in 95.8\% of cases' chromosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a cluster of PSP in a geographical area with severe environmental contamination by industrial metals.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: A phenotype of isolated parkinsonism mimicking Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) is a rare clinical presentation of GRN and C9orf72 mutations, the major genetic causes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It still remains controversial if this association is fortuitous or not, and which clinical clues could reliably suggest a genetic FTD etiology in IPD patients. This study aims to describe the clinical characteristics of FTD mutation carriers presenting with IPD phenotype, provide neuropathological evidence of the mutation's causality, and specifically address their "red flags" according to current IPD criteria.
METHODS: Seven GRN and C9orf72 carriers with isolated parkinsonism at onset, and three patients from the literature were included in this study. To allow better delineation of their phenotype, the presence of supportive, exclusion and "red flag" features from MDS criteria were analyzed for each case.
RESULTS: Amongst the ten patients (5 GRN, 5 C9orf72), seven fulfilled probable IPD criteria during all the disease course, while behavioral/language or motoneuron dysfunctions occurred later in three. Disease duration was longer and dopa-responsiveness was more sustained in C9orf72 than in GRN carriers. Subtle motor features, cognitive/behavioral changes, family history of dementia/ALS were suggestive clues for a genetic diagnosis. Importantly, neuropathological examination in one patient revealed typical TDP-43-inclusions without alpha-synucleinopathy, thus demonstrating the causal link between FTD mutations, TDP-43-pathology and PD phenotype.
CONCLUSION: We showed that, altogether, family history of early-onset dementia/ALS, the presence of cognitive/behavioral dysfunction and subtle motor characteristics are atypical features frequently present in the parkinsonian presentations of GRN and C9orf72 mutations.},

We conducted a brain metabolism (FDG-PET) and structural (cortical thickness) study to detect early changes in asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers (aGRN+) that were evaluated longitudinally over a 20-month period. At baseline, a left lateral temporal lobe hypometabolism was present in aGRN+ without any structural changes. Importantly, this is the first longitudinal study and, across time, the metabolism more rapidly decreased in aGRN+ in lateral temporal and frontal regions. The main structural change observed in the longitudinal study was a reduction of cortical thickness in the left lateral temporal lobe in carriers. A limit of this study is the relatively small sample (n = 16); nevertheless, it provides important results. First, it evidences that the pathological processes develop a long time before clinical onset, and that early neuroimaging changes might be detected approximately 20 years before the clinical onset of disease. Second, it suggests that metabolic changes are detectable before structural modifications and cognitive deficits. Third, both the baseline and longitudinal studies provide converging results implicating lateral temporal lobe as early involved in GRN disease. Finally, our study demonstrates that structural and metabolic changes could represent possible biomarkers to monitor the progression of disease in the presymptomatic stage toward clinical onset.},

METHODS: Participants were 4128 women and 2784 men 65 years or older from a population-based cohort recruited from 3 French cities. Cognitive performance, clinical diagnosis of dementia, and anticholinergic use were evaluated at baseline and 2 and 4 years later.
RESULTS: A total of 7.5\% of the participants reported anticholinergic drug use at baseline. Multivariate-adjusted logistic regression indicated that women reporting use of anticholinergic drugs at baseline showed greater decline over 4 years in verbal fluency scores (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.79) and in global cognitive functioning (OR, 1.22; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.55) than women not using anticholinergic drugs. In men, an association was found with decline in visual memory (OR, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.08-2.47) and to a lesser extent in executive function (OR, 1.47; 95\% CI, 0.89-2.44). Notable interactions were observed in women between anticholinergic use and age, apolipoprotein E, or hormone therapy. A 1.4- to 2-fold higher risk of cognitive decline was observed for those who continuously used anticholinergic drugs but not for those who had discontinued use. The risk of incident dementia over the 4-year follow-up period was also increased in continuous users (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.00-2.73) but not in those who discontinued the use of anticholinergic drugs (HR, 1.28; 95\% CI, 0.59-2.76).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly people taking anticholinergic drugs were at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Discontinuing anticholinergic treatment was associated with a decreased risk. Physicians should carefully consider prescription of anticholinergic drugs in elderly people, especially in the very elderly and in persons at high genetic risk for cognitive disorder.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to systematically review biological and imaging predictors of cognitive impairment after stroke.
METHOD: Studies were identified from bibliographic databases and reference lists, and were included if conducted in patients with acute stroke, with at least 30 patients, and a follow-up of at least 3 months. We included articles on potential biomarkers of cognitive impairment that pre-existed to stroke.
RESULTS: We identified 22,169 articles, including 20,349 with abstract. After analysis, 66 studies conducted in 42 cohorts met selection criteria. They included 30-9522 patients [median 170; interquartile range (IQR) 104-251] with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR 3-36). All studies met quality criteria for description of the study population and standardization of biomarkers. Twenty-nine studies met all quality criteria. There was no convincing evidence that any biological marker may predict cognitive impairment. The most consistent predictors of cognitive impairment after stroke were global atrophy and medial temporal lobe atrophy.
CONCLUSION: Pre-existing cerebral atrophy is the most consistent predictor of cognitive impairment that can be identified in patients with an acute stroke.},

We investigated the effect of donepezil treatment on cortical thickness in mild cognitively impaired subjects with the amnestic syndrome of the hippocampal type, a prodromal at-risk group for progression to AD dementia.
METHODS: Data were from a longitudinal analysis of a community-based multicenter suspected prodromal AD cohort diagnosed by the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (81 donepezil vs 92 placebo) enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group design using donepezil (10 mg/day). The study started in November 2006 and concluded in August 2010. All subjects underwent 2 brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, at baseline and at the end of the trial. Structural MRI images had been processed using the automated pipeline for longitudinal segmentation and surface reconstruction implemented in FreeSurfer. The primary outcome measure of this post hoc study was the annualized percentage change (APC) of cortical thickness.
RESULTS: The donepezil group exhibited reduced APC cortical thinning compared to placebo in the rostral anterior cingulate (right: P = .048; left: P = .032), the orbitofrontal (right: P = .012; left: P {\textless} .048), and the right inferior frontal (P = .022) cortices and in the right insula (P = .010). These results were not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction likely due to insufficient power for cortical thickness measurements in the study group powered for the predefined hippocampus outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that cortical thickness is a reliable candidate surrogate outcome in early predementia AD trials. In addition, donepezil treatment may have an impact on cortical structure/morphology in areas innervated by the medial and lateral cholinergic pathways.

RESULTS: Two hundred five patients were enrolled with evaluable florbetaben PET scans; 64.4\% of scans were amyloid positive. PET results led to changed diagnosis and improved confidence in 66.8\% and 81.5\% of patients, respectively, and altered management in 80.0\% of cases.

In conclusion, these data indicate that the rs760678 SNP of the NEDD9 gene is at best a weak genetic determinant of AD or PD.},

	abstract = {Frontotemporal lobe degeneration includes a large spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. Patients with frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 exhibit heterogeneity in both clinical and neuropathological features. Here, we report the case of a young patient with a G389R mutation. This teenager girl was 17 years old when she progressively developed severe behavioral disturbances. First, she was considered to be suffering from atypical depression. After 2 years, she was referred to the department of neurology. By this time, the patient exhibited typical frontotemporal dementia with mild extrapyramidal disorders. The main behavioral features included apathy and reduced speech output. MRI and SPECT showed a frontotemporal atrophy and hypofixation, respectively. She died 7 years after onset. Three relatives on her father side had also died after early onset dementia. Genetic testing revealed a heterozygous guanine to cytosine mutation at the first base of codon 389 (Exon 13) of MAPT, the tau gene, resulting in a glycine to arginine substitution, in the patient and her non-affected father. Postmortem neuropathological and biochemical data indicate a Pick-like tau pathology but with phosphoserine 262-positive immunoreactivity. This case is remarkable because of the extremely early onset of the disease.},

Their long-term outcome has never been systematically and prospectively investigated. We aimed at identifying the long-term outcome of patients with ICH-m.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited consecutive adults with ICH-m and followed them up for at least 4.5 years. We classified patients into the following 3 groups: (i) definite or probable cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), (ii) deep perforating vasculopathy (DPV) and (iii) unknown causes.
RESULTS: Of 562 consecutive patients with ICH, 32 had ICH-m (5.7\%): 8 (25\%) with probable CAA, 5 (16\%) with DPV and 19 (59\%) with ICH-m of undetermined cause. At the last visit (cumulative follow-up of 39.5 person-year), 27 patients (84\%) had died, and 3 of the 5 survivors were independent. Late-onset seizures, recurrent ICH-m (symptomatic or not) and new brain microbleeds were mainly found in patients with probable CAA.
CONCLUSIONS: ICH-m is a rare but extremely severe expression of ICH. Survivors with CAA are more likely to develop late seizures and new hemorrhagic lesions. Because of low survival rates, large multicenter cohort studies are needed for a better understanding of this rare condition.},

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the putative association between VRFs and EOAD.
METHODS: We studied participants with dementia meeting criteria for EOAD (recruited into the French CoMAJ prospective cohort study from 1 June 2009 to 28 February 2014) and age-, gender-matched controls (ratio 1:3, drawn randomly from the French MONA-LISA population-based survey between 2005 and 2007). Demographic data, VRFs, comorbidities, treatments, and APOE genotypes were compared in multivariable logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: We studied 102 participants with dementia (mean±standard deviation age: 59.5±3.8; women: 59.8\%) and 306 controls. Compared with controls, EOAD participants had spent less time in formal education (9.9±2.9 versus 11.7±3.8 y; p {\textless} 0.0001), were less likely to be regular alcohol consumers (p {\textless} 0.0001), had a lower body mass index (-2 kg/m2; p {\textless} 0.0004), and a lower mean systolic blood pressure (-6.2 mmHg; p = 0.0036). The prevalence of APOE ɛ4 allele was higher in participants with dementia than in controls (50\% versus 29.4\%; p = 0.0002), as was the prevalence of depression (48\% versus 32\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Similar results were observed in multivariable analysis. Compared with EOAD participants lacking VRFs, EOAD participants with at least one VRF had a higher prevalence of depression (29.6\% versus 53.3\%, respectively; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of VRFs is not elevated in EOAD patients (in contrast to older AD patients). Extensive genetic testing should be considered more frequently in the context of EOAD.},

Most known GRN mutations are null mutations, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, which create a premature stop codon resulting in loss of function of the progranulin protein. Complete or near-complete genomic GRN deletions have also been found in three families, but heterozygous partial deletions that remove only one or two exons have not been reported to date. In this study, we analysed three unrelated FTLD patients with low plasma progranulin levels but no point GRN mutations by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF). We detected two heterozygous partial GRN deletions in two patients. One deletion removed exon 1 and part of intron 1. The second deletion was complex: it removed 1,410 bp extending from the part of intron 1 to the part of exon 3, with a small 5-bp insertion at the breakpoint junction (c.-7-1121\_159delinsGATCA). Our findings illustrate the usefulness of a quantitative analysis in addition to GRN gene sequencing for a comprehensive genetic diagnosis of FTLD, particularly in patients with low plasma progranulin levels.},

However, the impact of CSF biomarkers in MCI populations in clinical practice has been poorly evaluated. The objective of this study is to assess the use and impact in clinical practice of AD CSF biomarkers in French memory clinics.
DESIGN: We performed a nation-wide, prospective survey between March 2012 and September 2014. Data over the same period was extracted from the French National Database (Banque Nationale Alzheimer, BNA) and compared with the results of the survey.
SETTING: 29 secondary and tertiary memory clinics in France.
PARTICIPANTS: Clinicians prescribing lumbar puncture (LP) in order to measure AD CSF biomarkers. Clinicians completed a two-part questionnaire for each of their patients undergoing LP.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of diagnosis, level of confidence before and after CSF biomarkers and impact on management in patients who underwent LP for CSF AD biomarkers in clinical routine.
RESULTS: 977 questionnaires were completed, of which 61 were excluded because of unknown initial/final diagnosis or non-contributory CSF results. Of 916 patients reported, 153 (16.7\%) had MCI as the initial diagnosis, of which 51 (33.3\%) displayed an AD profile. CSF biomarkers resulted in a change in diagnosis in 44 patients (28.8\%). Confidence level significantly increased after LP (8.3±1.4vs 6.73±1.18, p{\textless}0.0001), and CSF results modified management in 71/156 patients (46.4\%), including 36 (23.5\%) enrolled in clinical trials. Comparison of change in diagnosis with the BNA population revealed no difference (32.24\%, p=0.4).

OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of MTLA on the long-term risk of dementia after stroke, after excluding the patients who had prestroke dementia.
METHODS: The study was conducted in 144 consecutive patients who had a stroke, who were aged 40 years or older (66 women and 78 men; median age, 72 years), and who had an Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly score lower than 104. On admission to the hospital all patients underwent a noncontrast computed tomographic scan including temporal lobe-positioned slices. A cut-off of 11.5 mm was used to differentiate patients with MTLA from those without MTLA. Patients were followed up with clinical and cognitive assessments over a 3-year period.
RESULTS: Three years after stroke, 34 patients (23.6\%) had developed new-onset dementia. The cumulative proportion of survivors without dementia was 57.6\% in patients with MTLA and 80.8\% in patients without MTLA (P =.02). The unadjusted relative risk of poststroke dementia associated with MTLA was 2.3 (95\% confidence interval, 1.1-4.7). However, using the Cox proportional hazards model, MTLA did not seem to be an independent predictor of poststroke dementia. Independent predictors of poststroke dementia were increasing age, diabetes mellitus, severity of the clinical deficit at admission, and severity of leukoaraiosis on computed tomography.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had a stroke and MTLA more frequently develop dementia than patients without MTLA, but our study does not suggest that MTLA independently contributes to dementia. A longer follow-up may be necessary to reevaluate the influence of MTLA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subclinical vascular or degenerative lesions occur in the brain before the clinical expression of dementia. Those lesions in a brain that just experienced a stroke may have lower thresholds for early epileptic seizures. Therefore, epileptic seizures may be a marker of subclinical brain lesions, which may lead to dementia.
OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that patients with stroke who have epileptic seizures without dementia have an increased risk of new-onset dementia.
METHODS: 169 consecutive patients with stroke without pre-existing dementia recruited in the Lille Stroke/Dementia Study were investigated (90 men; 150 ischaemic strokes; median age 73 years). Pre-stroke cognitive functions were evaluated with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), with a cut-off of 104 for the diagnosis of dementia. The patients were followed up over a 3-year period. Dementia was diagnosed with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision criteria in survivors who underwent neurological visits, and with the IQCODE score in those who could not. The relationship between epileptic seizures and new-onset dementia was studied within 3 years, using life-table methods.
RESULTS: 9 patients (5.3\%; 95\% CI 2.9 to 8.7\%) had early seizures. Epileptic seizures were independent predictors of new-onset dementia within 3 years after stroke (HR 3.81; 95\% CI 1.13 to 12.82), with increasing age (HR 1.04; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.08), IQCODE scores at admission (HR 1.08; 95\% CI 1.02 to 1.13) and diabetes mellitus (HR 3.52; 95\% CI 1.46 to 8.47).
CONCLUSION: Patients with stroke who have epileptic seizures may be at increased risk of dementia. Whether cognitive follow-up should be systematically performed in those patients remains to be validated.},

	abstract = {In intracerebral haemorrhage, the most frequent underlying vasculopathies are cerebral amyloid angiopathy and hypertensive vasculopathy. Although both are associated with cognitive impairment, no study has focused on pre-existing dementia in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, we aimed to determine prevalence and mechanisms of pre-existing dementia in a large cohort of patients with an intracerebral haemorrhage. In a cohort of 417 patients, we evaluated the cognitive status before intracerebral haemorrhage with the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. The cut-off to diagnose cognitive impairment with no dementia was 53 and 64 for pre-existing dementia. We determined factors associated with pre-existing dementia in multivariate analyses in the overall cohort and among patients with lobar only or deep only intracerebral haemorrhages. We performed post-mortem examinations when possible. Of 417 patients (median age 72 years, interquartile range 58-79), 58 (14\%; 95\% CI 11-18\%) patients had cognitive impairment with no dementia and 65 had pre-existing dementia (16\%; 95\% CI 12-19\%). In lobar intracerebral haemorrhage, the prevalence was 23\%, and factors associated with pre-existing dementia were increasing age (odds ratio: 1.09 per year; 95\% CI 1.02-1.15), having {\textless}8 years of education (odds ratio: 8.37; 95\% CI 1.91-36.65) and increasing cortical atrophy (odds ratio: 3.34 per step; 95\% CI 1.40-7.96). The five autopsied patients had Alzheimer's disease with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. In deep intracerebral haemorrhage, factors associated with pre-existing dementia were presence of old territorial vascular lesions (odds ratio: 4.52; 95\% CI 1.18-17.42) and increasing severity of leucoaraiosis (odds ratio: 4.11 per step; 95\% CI 1.73-9.75); the autopsied patient had small-vessel disease without Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the fact that pre-existing dementia is frequent in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage and may be the consequence of two different mechanisms: neurodegeneration with Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy in lobar intracerebral haemorrhage versus vascular process in deep intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings may contribute to the improvement of prevention and management of patients with intracerebral haemorrhages.},

	abstract = {Small vessel diseases (SVDs) of the brain are likely to become increasingly common in tandem with the rise in the aging population. In recent years, neuroimaging and pathological studies have informed on the pathogenesis of sporadic SVD and several single gene (monogenic) disorders predisposing to subcortical strokes and diffuse white matter disease. However, one of the limitations toward studying SVD lies in the lack of consistent assessment criteria and lesion burden for both clinical and pathological measures. Arteriolosclerosis and diffuse white matter changes are the hallmark features of both sporadic and hereditary SVDs. The pathogenesis of the arteriopathy is the key to understanding the differential progression of disease in various SVDs. Remarkably, quantification of microvascular abnormalities in sporadic and hereditary SVDs has shown that qualitatively the processes involved in arteriolar degeneration are largely similar in sporadic SVD compared with hereditary disorders such as cerebral autosomal arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Important significant regional differences in lesion location within the brain may enable one to distinguish SVDs, where frontal lobe involvement appears consistently with almost every SVD, but others bear specific pathologies in other lobes, such as the temporal pole in CADASIL and the pons in pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy or PADMAL. Additionally, degenerative changes in the vascular smooth muscle cells, the cerebral endothelium and the basal lamina are often rapid and more aggressive in genetic disorders. Further quantification of other microvascular elements and even neuronal cells is needed to fully characterize SVD pathogenesis and to differentiate the usefulness of vascular interventions and treatments on the resulting pathology.},

	abstract = {AIM: Brain clusterin is known to be associated with the amyloid-β deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed the distribution of clusterin immunoreactivity in cerebrovascular disorders, particularly focusing on white matter changes in small vessel diseases.
METHODS: Post-mortem brain tissues from the frontal or temporal lobes of a total of 70 subjects with various disorders including cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and AD were examined using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We further used immunogold electron microscopy to study clusterin immunoreactivity in extracellular deposits in CADASIL.
RESULTS: Immunostaining with clusterin antibodies revealed strong localization in arterioles and capillaries, besides cortical neurones. We found that clusterin immunostaining was significantly increased in the frontal white matter of CADASIL and pontine autosomal dominant microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy subjects. In addition, clusterin immunostaining correlated with white matter pathology severity scores. Immunostaining in axons ranged from fine punctate deposits in single axons to larger confluent areas with numerous swollen axon bulbs, similar to that observed with known axon damage markers such as non-phosphorylated neurofilament H and the amyloid precursor protein. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy experiments showed that whereas clusterin immunoreactivity was closely associated with vascular amyloid-β in CAA, it was lacking within the granular osmiophilic material immunolabelled by NOTCH3 extracelluar domain aggregates found in CADASIL.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a wider role for clusterin associated with white matter damage in addition to its ability to chaperone proteins for clearance via the perivascular drainage pathways in several disease states.},

Methods: The relationship between cognitive and non-cognitive complaints and brain biomarkers, measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging, was investigated in 2056 participants of the MEMENTO cohort of outpatients, who were dementia-free at baseline. We assessed whether the cognitive status at inclusion or the presence of the apolipoprotein E gene variant (APOE) ε4 could modulate the association between the intensity of complaints and brain lesions.
Results: Smaller hippocampal volume was associated with higher memory complaints and discomfort in daily life. In APOE ε4 carriers, smaller whole-brain white matter and gray matter volumes and gyrification indices in several regions of interest of the parietal and temporal lobes, in the entorhinal and the para-hippocampal gyrus, were associated with higher memory complaint score.
Conclusions: The intensity of subjective complaints in not only memory but discomfort in daily life was associated with brain degeneration markers. The presence of APOE ε4 modulated the relationships between subjective memory complaints and brain alterations.},

On magnetic resonance imaging, white matter changes are frequently observed, while the number of lacunar infarcts is probably underestimated. The present study post-mortem 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging study compares the severity and the distribution of white matter changes and lacunar infarcts in different neurodegenerative and vascular dementia syndromes in order to determine their impact on the disease evolution.
Patients and methods: Eighty-four post-mortem brains consisting of 15 patients with pure Alzheimer's disease and 12 with associated cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 14 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 7 with Lewy body dementia, 10 with progressive supranuclear palsy, 14 with vascular dementia and 12 control brains were examined. Six hemispheric coronal sections of each brain underwent 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Location and severity of white matter changes and lacunar infarcts were evaluated semi-quantitatively in each section separately.
Results: White matter changes predominated in the prefrontal and frontal sections of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and in the post-central section of associated cerebral amyloid angiopathy brains, while overall increased in vascular dementia cases. Lacunar infarcts were more frequent in the vascular dementia brains and mainly increased in the centrum semiovale.
Conclusions: White matter changes have a different topographic distribution in neurodegenerative diseases and are most severe and extended in vascular dementia. Lacunar infarcts predominate in the deep white matter of vascular dementia compared to the neurodegenerative diseases. Vascular cognitive impairment is mainly linked to white matter changes due to chronic ischaemia as well as to lacunar infarcts due to small-vessel occlusion.},

The existence of a "pure" type of vascular dementia (VaD) is controversial. There is a need to find magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics allowing the distinction between VaD and MixD. The present post-mortem 7.0-tesla MRI compares the frequency or severity and the topography of the small cerebrovascular lesions in brains of patients with VaD and with MixD. \textbf{Material and methods}: Based on neuropathological criteria, 14 brains were classified as VaD, 24 as MixD and 11 as controls. Three coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere and a horizontal section of a cerebellar hemisphere underwent T2 and T2* 7.0-tesla MRI examination. The mean values and topographic distribution of white matter changes (WMCs), lacunar infarcts (LIs), cortical microbleeds (CoMBs) and cortical microinfarcts (CoMIs) were determined and compared between the different groups. \textbf{Results}: Compared to the controls, both VaD and MixD brains had significantly more severe WMCs and increased numbers of CoMBs and CoMIs. Lacunar infarcts predominated only in the VaD cases. On mutual comparison of VaD and MixD brains, CoMBs and CoMIs predominated in the frontal lobe and the cerebellum of VaD, while were mainly present in the occipital lobe of MixD. White matter changes predominated in the temporal lobe of MixD cases. Lacunar infarcts were significantly increased in the corona radiata and putamen of VaD patients. \textbf{Conclusions}: The present post-mortem MRI study shows clear differences in the distribution and the types of cerebrovascular lesions on high-field MRI, confirming that VaD and MixD are different diseases. }.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a degenerative disease affecting mainly the brain stem, basal ganglia and cerebellum. Associated cerebrovascular lesions, mainly small cerebral bleeds, are frequently observed in some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer dementia and rare in others such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The present post-mortem study investigates the prevalence and distribution of small cerebral bleeds in PSP brains.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen brains of PSP patients were compared to 12 age-matched controls. The prevalence and distribution of mini-bleeds were investigated on a coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere at the level of the mamillary bodies and on a horizontal section through the pons and cerebellum. In addition, out of these series T2*-weighted gradient-echo 7.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 3 coronal sections of a cerebral hemisphere and of a brain stem and cerebellum was performed in 14 PSP and 11 control brains.
RESULTS: Although the total number of mini-bleeds was the same on neuropathological examination of both groups, they prevailed around the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (p = 0.05) and in the tegmentum pontis (p = 0.05) of the PSP brains. On MRI the small bleeds were also more frequent around the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum (p = 0.02) and in the pons (p = 0.04) of PSP brains.
DISCUSSION: In PSP brains, mini-bleeds only prevail in the regions affected by the neurodegenerative process, similarly to what happens in frontotemporal lobar degeneration. They should be considered as the result of increased angiogenesis and microglial activation, leading to associated disturbances of the blood-brain barrier in the most affected regions of PSP. They are not indicative of cerebrovascular disease.},

In "vivo" 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unreliable to detect the age-related signal changes in LCHs. This post-mortem study investigates the validity of the Boston criteria in brains with LCHs and the signal changes during their time course with 7.0-tesla MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen CAA brains including 26 LCHs were compared to 13 non-CAA brains with 14 LCHs. The evolution of the signal changes with time was examined in 25 LCHs with T2 and T2* 7.0-tesla MRI.
RESULTS: In the CAA group LCHs were predominantly located in the parieto-occipital lobes. Also white matter changes were more severe with more cortical microinfarcts and cortical microbleeds. On MRI there was a progressive shift of the intensity of the hyposignal from the haematoma core in the acute stage to the boundaries later on. During the residual stage the hyposignal mildly decreased in the boundaries with an increase of the superficial siderosis and haematoma core collapse.
CONCLUSIONS: Our post-mortem study of LCHs confirms the validity of the Boston criteria for CAA. Also 7.0-tesla MRI allows staging the age of the LCHs.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty brains of demented patients with autopsy-proven Lewy body disease were compared to 14 brains of age-matched controls.
RESULTS: Associated Alzheimer disease (AD) features, stages I-IV, were present in 70\% of the LBD brains and in 7\% of the controls (P{\textless}0.001). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) was only present in 30\% and lipohyalinosis in 10\%. A semi-quantitative analysis, performed on a coronal section of a whole cerebral hemisphere and on a horizontal section through the pons and the cerebellum, revealed significantly more mini-bleeds in the LBD brains (P=0.007), predominantly in the cerebral cortex (P=0.03). Other cerebrovascular lesions were only rarely observed. Comparison of the LDB brains, with and without moderate AD features and CAA, showed no difference in the severity of the cerebrovascular lesions including mini-bleeds.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mini-bleeds in LBD brains appears to be independent from the co-existence of moderate AD pathology and CAA. It is more probably due to disturbances of the blood-brain barrier, related to the neurodegenerative process itself.},

The present study compares the frequency of different associated lesions in these disease groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Out of a series of 252 autopsied patients 36 with MixD, 20 with VaD and 64 with AD disease were compared concerning the frequency of the associated lesions. Small cerebrovascular lesions were evaluated on a large coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere. Mean values of frequency and severity were compared between the 3 groups.
RESULTS: Of the 120 examined brains 30\% were classified as MixD, 17\% as VaD and 53\% as AD. In 20\% of the AD patients Lewy body pathology (LBP) was observed with a low incidence of cerebrovascular lesions, except for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The MixD patients had more severe CAA and were significantly older than those with VaD and AD. Lacunar infarcts, on the other hand, were significantly more frequent in the VaD patients.
DISCUSSION: The most responsible vascular lesions in MixD and VaD are different. There is an inverse correlation between the presence of LBP and vascular pathology. MixD has to be considered as the end stage of AD.},

The mean number of CoMIs was significantly increased in the inferior frontal and in the cingulate gyri of VaD brains compared to the controls. No topographic differences were observed in the neurodegenerative diseases.
KEY MESSAGES: As the inferior frontal and the cingulated gyri are areas frequently involved in VaD, CoMIs in those strategic locations must have an impact on the evolution of the vascular cognitive decline in those patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As cortical microbleeds and microinfarcts in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases have been studied predominantly at the level of the cerebral hemispheres and linked to the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), we aimed at determining with 7.0-tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) whether the causes and the frequency of cortical cerebellar microbleeds (CCeMBs) and microinfarcts (CCeMIs) are the same.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hundred and four postmortem brains, composed of 29 with pure Alzheimer's disease (AD), 9 with AD associated to CAA, 10 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 9 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 10 with Lewy body disease, 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy, 9 with vascular dementia (VaD), and 16 controls, were examined. On a horizontal section of a cerebellar hemisphere examined with 7.0-tesla MRI, the number CCeMBs and CCeMIs were compared between the different disease groups and the control group. The MRI findings were also compared with the corresponding mean values observed on histological examination of a separate standard horizontal section of a cerebellar hemisphere, used for diagnostic purpose.
RESULTS: CCeMBs and CCeMIs were only significantly increased in the VaD group. When comparing the diseased patients with and without CAA mutually and with those with arterial hypertension and severe atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, only in the latter an increase of CCeMBs and CCeMIs was observed. There was an excellent correlation between the MRI and the neuropathological findings.
CONCLUSIONS: CCeMBs and CCeMIs are mainly due to atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease and not due to CAA. Their increased presence cannot be included to the Boston diagnostic criteria for CAA.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of dementia is increasing in our aging population. Because of the complexity of disease pathology, dementia classifications remain controversial. The present post-mortem study investigates whether there are age differences between dementia brains with a single pure neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease and those with mixed pathological features. Also, the impact of these vascular lesions is compared.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 132 dementia brains with a pure neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease and 84 with mixed features were examined. Main age and gender distribution were compared between the overall group of pure and of mixed dementia. Also, the most common subgroups were compared separately. In addition to the detection of macroscopic visible lesions, a whole coronal section of a cerebral hemisphere, at the level of the mamillary body, was taken for semi-quantitative microscopic evaluation of white matter changes (WMCs), cortical micro-bleeds (CoMBs), and cortical micro-infarcts (CoMIs).
RESULTS: Overall, patients with mixed dementia were at death significantly older than those with pure dementia. According to the main diagnosis, the pure forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) were more common in the younger age groups while in the older ones the mixed form of Lewy body disease (LBD) predominated. Neuropathological examination revealed an increased severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), territorial infarcts, lobar haematomas, and CoMIs in the mixed AD group. In FTLD only CoMIs were increased in the mixed group, while in LBD no differences in severity of all cerebrovascular lesions were observed. Lacunar infarcts were more frequent in pure vascular dementia, while CAA predominated in the mixed one.
CONCLUSIONS: Mixed dementia during the aging process is mainly due to the severity of AD and LBD pathologies combined with CAA-related cerebrovascular lesions.},

The authors' aim was to assess the prevalence and determinants of cognitive impairment in patients hospitalized for CHF decompensation. The authors prospectively performed the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and completed a standardized questionnaire for cerebrovascular accidents (CVA) and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in patients hospitalized for CHF decompensation during a 3-month period. A total of 83 patients were studied: 15 had a history of CVA or TIA, 51 (61\%) had an MMSE score {\textless} or = 28 (or {\textless} or = 26 if schooling {\textless} or = 8 years), and 26 (31\%) had an MMSE score {\textless}24. Factors associated with an MMSE score {\textless}24 were atrial fibrillation/flutter (odds ratio [OR], 8.1; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-34.6), New York Heart Association functional class IV (OR, 4.1; CI, 1.0-16.4), and schooling {\textgreater}8 years (OR, 0.2; CI, 0.0-0.8). Adjusting for history of CVA or TIA or excluding patients with a history of CVA or TIA did not affect the findings. Cognitive impairment is frequent in patients hospitalized for CHF decompensation whether or not they have a past history of CVA or TIA. The severity of cognitive impairment parallels that of CHF. The question of whether this cognitive impairment decreases adherence to treatment and contributes to a worse outcome in CHF patients should be explored.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It has been suggested that subcortical lesions may influence cognitive performances at early stages of cognitive impairment but not in late stages of dementia. We aimed to test whether cognitive decline is associated with subcortical hyperintensities in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We included 170 consecutive MCI patients (mean follow-up, 3.8+/-1.6 years). We assessed subcortical hyperintensities on a baseline magnetic resonance imaging scan with a semiquantitative rating scale. The mean annual cognitive decline was calculated with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Dementia Rating Scale at baseline and the end of follow-up.
RESULTS: Compared with patients whose cognitive performances remained stable or improved during follow-up, patients whose cognitive performances declined often had a larger amount (greater than the median of the distribution) of periventricular (PVH) (P=0.0005) and white-matter (P=0.02) hyperintensities. The rate of cognitive decline was higher with increasing PVH: mean change in the Mini-Mental State Examination score=0.16 vs -0.66 points/year in patients with PVH in the first versus third tertile (P=0.0002). The rate of decline in executive functioning was also higher with increasing PVH: mean change in the Dementia Rating Scale initiation subscore=-0.05 vs -1.42 points/year in patients with PVH in the first versus third tertile (P=0.04). These associations were independent of vascular risk factors, temporal lobe atrophy, and MCI subtype and were stronger in patients with baseline executive dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: White-matter hyperintensities and especially PVH were significantly associated with cognitive decline in MCI patients. This result was independent of the MCI subtype but stronger in cases of executive dysfunction at baseline.},

One important gap of knowledge is the relationship between tauopathy in the hippocampal formation, ageing, AD, and cognitive impairment. Here we show that the multidisciplinary analysis of numerous brains from non-demented and demented patients suggests the following observations: tauopathy of the hippocampal formation in humans is age-related but not an age-dependent process, also independent of AD, but amplified by APP dysfunctions. Tauopathy in the entorhinal and hippocampal formation could be another type of pathological dysfunction of tau proteins, and a therapeutic target to delay AD.

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 42-year-old woman presenting with amnesia without neurologic focal signs at clinical examination. The neuroimaging features consisted of bilateral limbic hyperintensities on T2-weighted and FLAIR brain MRI. Despite exhaustive biologic and radiologic investigations, no specific etiology was found. The diagnosis of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis was suspected, although antineuronal antibodies were negative and no cancer was detected after the first evaluation. Eight months after onset, the memory complaint of the patient increased along with disability in activities of the daily living, the neurologic examination slightly changed with frontal neurologic signs and the brain MRI showed a new cystic lesion in the left hippocampus with enhancement after contrast administration. The left temporal tumor was resected and the neuropathological examination was consistent with gliomatosis cerebri with a focal high grade astrocytoma.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need to consider the possibility of infiltrative gliomatosis in patients presenting with features of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.},

Clinical, imaging, neuropathological, and biochemical data are presented. The proband was a woman who died at 85 years old, 25 years after the onset of a slowly progressive and isolated anarthria and opercular syndrome. The pathological examination of her brain showed marked atrophy of primary motor and premotor cortices, associated with predominant neuronal tau-positive lesions mimicking Pick bodies. At the biochemical level, the six tau isoforms aggregate to display a pathological triplet at 60, 64, and 69 kDa. Two of her sons presented at 48 and 50 years old with a right temporal variant of frontotemporal degeneration characterized by severe prosopagnosia, semantic impairment, and behavioral modifications. In these three patients, the molecular analysis of MAPT showed the c.1945C{\textgreater}T mutation on exon 11 resulting in the P332S substitution in tau sequence. This mutation changes the PGGG motif of the third repeat domain of the protein and therefore reduces the ability of tau to bind microtubule.

Whether their treatment can slow down the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD) remains unsettled. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate whether the treatment of VRF is associated with a slower cognitive decline in patients who have AD without cerebrovascular disease (CVD).
METHODS: We recruited 301 consecutive patients who had AD without CVD (mean age 71.7 years; 69.4\% women; first Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] mean score 21.6; mean follow-up 2.3 years), who had attended a memory clinic between 1997 and 2003. VRF sought were high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, and atherosclerotic disease. Only 21 patients (7.0\%) had no VRF. Others were classified as having no VRF treated (n = 72; 25.7\%), some VRF treated (n = 119; 42.5\%), or all VRF treated (n = 89; 31.8\%). We compared MMSE progression over time among these 3 groups using a mixed random effects regression model.
RESULTS: Baseline MMSE scores were similar in the 3 groups. With adjustment for confounding factors, MMSE progression over time differed significantly between groups (p = 0.002). Patients with all their VRF treated declined less than those with none of their VRF treated. Those with some VRF treated tended to have an intermediate decline.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who have Alzheimer disease without CVD, treatment of vascular risk factors (VRF) is associated with a slower decline in Mini-Mental State Examination score. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association, but our data suggest that dementia should not prevent treatment of VRF.},

To assess the physiological relevance of an allelic variation in the KNS2 gene, the association analysis of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 5'UTR or in intronic sequences of KNS2 gene were performed in 100 AD brain patients and in 103 controls.

No synergistic effects were found between the APOE epsilon 4 allele and KNS2 gene polymorphisms.},

Using TissueInfo to screen for genes preferentially expressed in the hippocampus and located in AD linkage regions, we identified a gene on 10q24.33 that we call CALHM1. We show that CALHM1 encodes a multipass transmembrane glycoprotein that controls cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and Abeta levels. CALHM1 homomultimerizes, shares strong sequence similarities with the selectivity filter of the NMDA receptor, and generates a large Ca(2+) conductance across the plasma membrane. Importantly, we determined that the CALHM1 P86L polymorphism (rs2986017) is significantly associated with AD in independent case-control studies of 3404 participants (allele-specific OR = 1.44, p = 2 x 10(-10)). We further found that the P86L polymorphism increases Abeta levels by interfering with CALHM1-mediated Ca(2+) permeability. We propose that CALHM1 encodes an essential component of a previously uncharacterized cerebral Ca(2+) channel that controls Abeta levels and susceptibility to late-onset AD.},

METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel group design using donepezil (10 mg/day) in subjects with suspected prodromal AD. Subjects underwent two brain magnetic resonance imaging scans (baseline and final visit). The primary efficacy outcome was the annualized percentage change (APC) of total hippocampal volume (left + right) measured by an automated segmentation method.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and sixteen only subjects were randomized across 28 French expert clinical sites. In the per protocol population (placebo = 92 and donepezil = 82), the donepezil group exhibited a significant reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy (APC = -1.89\%) compared with the placebo group (APC = -3.47\%), P {\textless} .001. There was no significant difference in neuropsychological performance between treatment groups.
DISCUSSION: A 45\% reduction of rate of hippocampal atrophy was observed in prodromal AD following 1 year of treatment with donepezil compared with placebo.},

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid beta or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid beta as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

The recent advances in use of reliable biomarkers of AD that provide in-vivo evidence of the disease has stimulated the development of new research criteria that reconceptualise the diagnosis around both a specific pattern of cognitive changes and structural/biological evidence of Alzheimer's pathology. This new diagnostic framework has stimulated debate about the definition of AD and related conditions. The potential for drugs to intercede in the pathogenic cascade of the disease adds some urgency to this debate. This paper by the International Working Group for New Research Criteria for the Diagnosis of AD aims to advance the scientific discussion by providing broader diagnostic coverage of the AD clinical spectrum and by proposing a common lexicon as a point of reference for the clinical and research communities. The cornerstone of this lexicon is to consider AD solely as a clinical and symptomatic entity that encompasses both predementia and dementia phases.},

This Position Paper considers the strengths and limitations of the IWG research diagnostic criteria and proposes advances to improve the diagnostic framework. On the basis of these refinements, the diagnosis of AD can be simplified, requiring the presence of an appropriate clinical AD phenotype (typical or atypical) and a pathophysiological biomarker consistent with the presence of Alzheimer's pathology. We propose that downstream topographical biomarkers of the disease, such as volumetric MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET, might better serve in the measurement and monitoring of the course of disease.

The aim of this study was to document the unmet support needs of this specific group of caregivers. This knowledge is essential to open avenues for the development of innovative interventions and professional services tailored to their specific needs.
METHODS: This study was conducted using a mixed research design. Participants were 32 family caregivers in their 50s recruited through memory clinics and Alzheimer Societies in Quebec (Canada). The Family Caregivers Support Agreement (FCSA) tool, based on a partnership approach between caregiver and assessor, was used to collect data in the course of a semi-structured interview, combined with open-ended questions.
RESULTS: The unmet support needs reported by nearly 70\% of the caregivers were primarily of a psycho-educational nature. Caregivers wished primarily: (1) to receive more information on available help and financial resources; (2) to have their relatives feel valued as persons and to offer them stimulating activities adjusted to their residual abilities; (3) to reduce stress stemming from their caregiver role assumed at an early age and to have the chance to enjoy more time for themselves; and (4) to receive help at the right time and for the help to be tailored to their situation of caregiver of a young person.
CONCLUSIONS: Results show numerous unmet support needs, including some specific to this group of family caregivers. Use of the FCSA tool allowed accurately assessing the needs that emerged from mutual exchanges. Avenues for professional innovative interventions are proposed.},

	doi = {10.1093/brain/awaa018},
	abstract = {The behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a frequent cause of early-onset dementia. The diagnosis of bvFTD remains challenging because of the limited accuracy of neuroimaging in the early disease stages and the absence of molecular biomarkers, and therefore relies predominantly on clinical assessment. BvFTD shows significant symptomatic overlap with non-degenerative primary psychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders and even personality disorders. To date, ∼50\% of patients with bvFTD receive a prior psychiatric diagnosis, and average diagnostic delay is up to 5-6 years from symptom onset. It is also not uncommon for patients with primary psychiatric disorders to be wrongly diagnosed with bvFTD. The Neuropsychiatric International Consortium for Frontotemporal Dementia was recently established to determine the current best clinical practice and set up an international collaboration to share a common dataset for future research. The goal of the present paper was to review the existing literature on the diagnosis of bvFTD and its differential diagnosis with primary psychiatric disorders to provide consensus recommendations on the clinical assessment. A systematic literature search with a narrative review was performed to determine all bvFTD-related diagnostic evidence for the following topics: bvFTD history taking, psychiatric assessment, clinical scales, physical and neurological examination, bedside cognitive tests, neuropsychological assessment, social cognition, structural neuroimaging, functional neuroimaging, CSF and genetic testing. For each topic, responsible team members proposed a set of minimal requirements, optimal clinical recommendations, and tools requiring further research or those that should be developed. Recommendations were listed if they reached a ≥ 85\% expert consensus based on an online survey among all consortium participants. New recommendations include performing at least one formal social cognition test in the standard neuropsychological battery for bvFTD. We emphasize the importance of 3D-T1 brain MRI with a standardized review protocol including validated visual atrophy rating scales, and to consider volumetric analyses if available. We clarify the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET for the exclusion of bvFTD when normal, whereas non-specific regional metabolism abnormalities should not be over-interpreted in the case of a psychiatric differential diagnosis. We highlight the potential role of serum or CSF neurofilament light chain to differentiate bvFTD from primary psychiatric disorders. Finally, based on the increasing literature and clinical experience, the consortium determined that screening for C9orf72 mutation should be performed in all possible/probable bvFTD cases or suspected cases with strong psychiatric features.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The natural history and disease mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are still poorly understood. Very few resources are available to scrutinise patients as early as needed and to use integrative approaches combining standardised, repeated clinical investigations and cutting-edge biomarker measurements.
METHODS: In the nationwide French MEMENTO cohort study, participants were recruited in memory clinics and screened for either isolated subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; defined as test performance 1.5 SD below age, sex and education-level norms) while not demented (Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] {\textless}1). Baseline data collection included neurological and physical examinations as well as extensive neuropsychological testing. To be included in the MEMENTO cohort, participants had to agree to undergo both brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood sampling. Cerebral 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positon emission tomography and lumbar puncture were optional. Automated analyses of cerebral MRI included assessments of volumes of whole-brain, hippocampal and white matter lesions.
RESULTS: The 2323 participants, recruited from April 2011 to June 2014, were aged 71 years, on average (SD 8.7), and 62\% were women. CDR was 0 in 40\% of participants, and 30\% carried at least one apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. We observed that more than half (52\%) of participants had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (17\% single-domain aMCI), 32\% had non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (16.9\% single-domain naMCI) and 16\% had isolated SCCs. Multivariable analyses of neuroimaging markers associations with cognitive categories showed that participants with aMCI had worse levels of imaging biomarkers than the others, whereas participants with naMCI had markers at intermediate levels between SCC and aMCI. The burden of white matter lesions tended to be larger in participants with aMCI. Independently of CDR, all neuroimaging and neuropsychological markers worsened with age, whereas differences were not consistent according to sex.
CONCLUSIONS: MEMENTO is a large cohort with extensive clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data and represents a platform for studying the natural history of ADRD in a large group of participants with different subtypes of MCI (amnestic or not amnestic) or isolated SCCs.

	abstract = {Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of pathologies characterized by tau aggregation inside neurons. Most of them are sporadic but certain tauopathies rely on tau gene (MAPT) mutations. They particularly differ from one to another by their different neuropathological signatures e.g. lesion shapes, regions affected and molecular composition of aggregates. Six isoforms of tau exist, but they do not all co-aggregate in each tauopathy but rather have a unique signature for each one. In some tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau protein aggregation follows stereotypical anatomical stages. Recent data suggest that this progression is due to an active process of tau protein propagation from neuron-to-neuron. We wondered how tau isoforms or mutations could influence the process of tau aggregation and tau propagation. In human neuropathological material, we found that MAPT mutations induce a faster misfolding compared to tau found in sporadic AD patients. In the rat brain, we observed cell-to-cell transfer of non-pathological tau species irrespective of the tested isoform or presence of a mutation. By contrast, we found that the species of tau impact the propagation of tau pathology markers such as hyperphosphorylation and misfolding. Indeed, misfolding and hyperphosphorylated tau proteins do not spread at the same rate when tau is mutated, or the isoform composition is modified. These results clearly argue for the existence of specific folding properties of tau depending on isoforms or mutations impacting the behavior of pathological tau species.},

	abstract = {Men have a shorter life expectancy compared with women but the underlying factor(s) are not clear. Late-onset, sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is a common and lethal neurodegenerative disorder and many germline inherited variants have been found to influence the risk of developing AD. Our previous results show that a fundamentally different genetic variant, i.e., lifetime-acquired loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in blood cells, is associated with all-cause mortality and an increased risk of non-hematological tumors and that LOY could be induced by tobacco smoking. We tested here a hypothesis that men with LOY are more susceptible to AD and show that LOY is associated with AD in three independent studies of different types. In a case-control study, males with AD diagnosis had higher degree of LOY mosaicism (adjusted odds ratio = 2.80, p = 0.0184, AD events = 606). Furthermore, in two prospective studies, men with LOY at blood sampling had greater risk for incident AD diagnosis during follow-up time (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.80, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = 2.16-21.43, AD events = 140, p = 0.0011). Thus, LOY in blood is associated with risks of both AD and cancer, suggesting a role of LOY in blood cells on disease processes in other tissues, possibly via defective immunosurveillance. As a male-specific risk factor, LOY might explain why males on average live shorter lives than females.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between age and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of β-amyloid (Aβ 1-42), total Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau-181), in AD and non-AD patients explored for cognitive disorders. 966 patients (AD, n=528; non-AD, n=438) were included between January 2008 and December 2010 (mean age, 69.5years; mean MMSE, 20.2) from three French memory centers. Multivariable linear regression models were used to study the relationship between CSF biomarker levels and age in AD and non-AD patients. The capacity of each CSF biomarker in discriminating patients was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves by quartile of distribution of age. In AD patients, older age was associated with higher CSF Aβ 1-42 and lower Tau levels. Conversely, in non-AD patients, age was associated with lower CSF Aβ 1-42, higher Tau, and higher pTau-181 levels. In sex-stratified analysis, these relationships were significant only in women. Using ROC curve analysis, CSF AD biomarkers were more discriminant in younger patients than in older ones. In this clinically-based study, younger patients with AD had exacerbated CSF anomalies compared to older patients with AD. CSF biomarkers were more discriminant in younger patients than in older ones for the diagnosis of AD, especially in women. These results support the idea of an overlap in AD neuropathological lesions in oldest subjects with or without AD.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-β (Aβ), tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau181) are now used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ40 is the most abundant Aβ peptide isoform in the CSF, and the Aβ 42/40 ratio has been proposed to better reflect brain amyloid production. However, its additional value in the clinical setting remains uncertain.
METHODS: A total of 367 subjects with cognitive disorders who underwent a lumbar puncture were prospectively included at three French memory centers (Paris-North, Lille and Montpellier; the PLM Study). The frequency of positive, negative and indeterminate CSF profiles were assessed by various methods, and their adequacies with the diagnosis of clinicians were tested using net reclassification improvement (NRI) analyses.
RESULTS: On the basis of local optimum cutoffs for Aβ42 and p-tau181, 22\% of the explored patients had indeterminate CSF profiles. The systematic use of Aβ 42/40 ratio instead of Aβ42 levels alone decreased the number of indeterminate profiles (17\%; P = 0.03), but it failed to improve the classification of subjects (NRI = -2.1\%; P = 0.64). In contrast, the use of Aβ 42/40 ratio instead of Aβ42 levels alone in patients with a discrepancy between p-tau181 and Aβ42 led to a reduction by half of the number of indeterminate profiles (10\%; P {\textless} 0.001) and was further in agreement with clinician diagnosis (NRI = 10.5\%; P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a discrepancy between CSF p-tau181 and CSF Aβ42, the assessment of Aβ 42/40 ratio led to a reliable biological conclusion in over 50\% of cases that agreed with a clinician's diagnosis.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between IGF-I and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) serum levels and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: In this multicentric cross-sectional study, 694 elderly subjects (218 men, 476 women; 78.6 ± 6.7 yr old) were included; 481 had memory complaints and were diagnosed, after comprehensive cognitive assessment, with AD (n = 224) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 257). The control group was comprised of 213 subjects without memory complaint and with normal cognition (recruited among patients' caregivers). IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were determined by ELISA.
RESULTS: IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were significantly associated with cognitive status in men (IGF-I, 137 ± 69 ng/ml for AD vs. 178 ± 88 ng/ml for MCI and 172 ± 91 ng/ml for controls, P = 0.01; IGFBP-3, 3675 ± 1542 ng/ml for AD vs. 4143 ± 1828 ng/ml for MCI and 4488 ± 1893 ng/ml for controls, P = 0.04). In women, IGFBP-3 was significantly associated with cognitive status (3781 ± 1351 ng/ml for AD vs. 4190 ± 1408 ng/ml for MCI and 4390 ± 1552 ng/ml for controls; P {\textless} 0.001), but no significant differences between groups for IGF-I occurred. After adjustment for confounding variables (age, educational level, body mass index, diabetes, apolipoprotein E ε4 status), logistic regression indicated that IGF-I [odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) = 0.48 (0.26-0.88)] and IGFBP-3 [odds ratio (95\% confidence interval) = 0.71 (0.52-0.97)] serum levels were independently associated with AD in men, but not in women.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that slower gait speed is longitudinally associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and falls in older adults. Despite this, the longitudinal relationship between gait speed, cognition and falls in those with a diagnosis of dementia remains poorly explored. We sought to assess this longitudinal relationship in a cohort of older adults with mild to-moderate Alzheimer Disease (AD).
METHODS: Analysis of data from NILVAD, an 18-month randomised-controlled trial of Nilvadipine in mild to moderate AD. We examined: (i) the cross-sectional (baseline) association between slow gait speed and cognitive function, (ii) the relationship between baseline slow gait speed and cognitive function at 18 months (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive Subsection: ADAS-Cog), (iii) the relationship between baseline cognitive function and incident slow gait speed at 18 months and finally (iv) the relationship of baseline slow gait speed and incident falls over the study period.
RESULTS: Overall, one-tenth (10.03\%, N = 37/369) of participants with mild-to-moderate AD met criteria for slow gait speed at baseline and a further 14.09\% (N = 52/369) developed incident slow gait speed at 18 months. At baseline, there was a significant association between poorer cognition and slow gait speed (OR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.01-1.09, p = 0.025). Whilst there was no association between baseline slow gait speed and change in ADAS-Cog score at 18 months, a greater cognitive severity at baseline predicted incident slow gait speed over 18 months (OR 1.04, 1.01-1.08, p = 0.011). Further, slow gait speed at baseline was associated with a significant risk of incident falls over the study period, which persisted after covariate adjustment (IRR 3.48, 2.05-5.92, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Poorer baseline cognition was associated with both baseline and incident slow gait speed. Slow gait speed was associated with a significantly increased risk of falls over the study period. Our study adds further evidence to the complex relationship between gait and cognition in this vulnerable group and highlights increased falls risk in older adults with AD and slow gait speed.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepines and related drugs (BDZRs) have been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in later life. Despite this, it remains unclear whether ongoing BDZR use may further accelerate cognitive decline in those diagnosed with mild to moderate AD.
DESIGN: This study was embedded within NILVAD, a randomized controlled trial of nilvadipine in mild to moderate AD. Cognition was measured at baseline and 18 months using the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale, Cognitive Subsection (ADAS-Cog). We assessed predictors of long-term BDZR use and analyzed the effect of ongoing BDZR use on ADAS-Cog scores at 18 months. Additionally, the impact of BDZR use on adverse events, incident delirium, and falls over 18-month follow-up was assessed adjusting for relevant covariates.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 448 participants with mild to moderate AD recruited from 23 academic centers in 9 European countries.
RESULTS: Overall, 14\% (62/448) were prescribed an ongoing BDZR for the study duration. Increasing total number of (non-BDZR) medications was associated with a greater likelihood of BDZR prescription (odds ratio 1.16, 95\% confidence interval 1.05-1.29). At 18 months, BDZR use was not associated with greater cognitive decline on the ADAS-Cog controlling for baseline ADAS-Cog scores, age, gender, study arm, and other clinical covariates (β = 1.62, -1.34 to 4.56). However, ongoing BDZR use was associated with a greater likelihood of adverse events [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.19, 1.05-1.34], incident delirium (IRR 2.31, 1.45-3.68), and falls (IRR 1.66, 1.02-2.65) over 18 months that persisted after robust adjustment for covariates.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This study found no effect of ongoing BDZR use on ADAS-Cog scores in those with mild to moderate AD over 18 months. However, ongoing use of these medications was associated with an increased risk of adverse events, delirium, and falls. Thus, BDZR use should be avoided where possible and deprescribing interventions should be encouraged in older adults with AD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults are frequently prescribed medications with sedative effects, which are associated with numerous adverse consequences. However, the prevalence and longitudinal associations of sedative medication use in community-dwelling older adults with mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not been explored to date.
OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the prevalence of sedative medication use in community-dwelling older adults with mild-moderate AD and examine the longitudinal association between sedative medication use and adverse events (AEs).
METHODS: The association between baseline sedative load (SL) and AEs, unscheduled healthcare utilisation, delirium and falls was assessed in older adults with mild-moderate AD over 18 months using secondary analysis of NILVAD trial data (collected from 2014 to 2016). Baseline medication use was assessed, and the SL model was applied to each participant's medication individually. The SL model classifies medications into one of four categories: (1) primary sedatives, (2) medications with a sedating component or prominent side effect, (3) medications with sedation as a potential adverse reaction and (4) all other medications with no known sedative side effects. Medications in group 1 were assigned an SL score of 2, those in group 2 were assigned an SL score of 1, and those in categories 3 and 4 an SL score of 0. SL scores for each medication participants were taking were summed and the total SL calculated as an arithmetic sum of individual medications score. A total SL score ≥ 3 was classed as high. Statistical analysis was conducted using Poisson regression and mixed-effects linear regression, with adjustment for important clinical covariates. We also assessed the impact of SL on dementia progression and cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Over half (55.7\% [284/510]) of those with mild-moderate AD (age 72.8 ± 8.3 years, 61.9\% female) were prescribed a regular medication with sedation as a primary effect or prominent side effect, with 22.2\% (113/510) having a high SL (≥ 3). The most common medications contributing to SL were antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and hypnotics. Over 18 months, increasing baseline SL was associated with incident AEs (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.19; p {\textless} 0.001), serious AEs (IRR 1.23; 95\% CI 1.11-1.36; p {\textless} 0.001) and unscheduled general practitioner visits (IRR 1.23; 95\% CI 1.13-1.34; p {\textless} 0.001). Further, increasing SL was associated with a greater likelihood of incident delirium (IRR 1.30; 95\% CI 1.11-1.53; p {\textless} 0.001) and falls (IRR 1.20; 95\% CI 1.03-1.42; p = 0.02). Associations persisted after robust covariate adjustment. SL was not associated with accelerated cognitive decline or AD progression.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, over half of older adults with mild-moderate AD were prescribed at least one drug with a sedative effect, and a significant minority had a high SL. Increasing baseline SL was associated with a greater likelihood of incident AEs, delirium and falls, highlighting the need for optimal prescribing in this potentially vulnerable cohort.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research has examined the relationship between episodic memory decline, the cognitive hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the presence of Apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele, a major genetic risk factor for the disease. Our review attempts to summarize and critically evaluate this literature. We performed a systematic search for studies assessing episodic memory in AD patients who were genotyped for APOE ε4 and identified fourteen papers. Although most of these papers reported significant relationships between APOE ε4 and episodic memory decline in AD, some papers did not confirm this relationship. Our review links this controversy to the conflicting literature about the effects of APOE ε4 on general cognitive functioning in AD. We identify several shortcoming and limitations of the research on the relationship between APOE ε4 and episodic memory in AD, such as small sample sizes, non-representative populations, lack of comparison of early-onset vs. late-onset disease, and lack of comparison among different genotypes that include APOE ε4 (i.e., zero, one, or two ε4 alleles). Another major shortcoming of the reviewed literature was the lack of comprehensive evaluation of episodic memory decline, since episodic memory was solely evaluated with regard to encoding and retrieval, omitting evaluation of core episodic features that decline in AD, such as context recall (e.g., how, where, and when an episodic event has occurred) and subjective experience of remembering (e.g., reliving, emotion and feeling during episodic recollection). Future research taking these limitations into consideration could illuminate the nature of the relationship between APOE ε4 and episodic memory decline in AD.},

	abstract = {Most research has mainly focused on the decline of the subjective experience in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few attempts have been made to evaluate whether subjective experience may be maintained in AD. In this narrative review, we attempt to provide a positive view, according to which patients with AD can enjoy, to some extent, subjective experience during memory retrieval. Memory and expression difficulties (e.g., aphasia) limit the ability of patients with AD to describe their memories, resulting in a little specificity of reported memories. However, according to the "authentic subjective experience" view, we propose in this study that the ability to mentally relive these memories could be preserved in the patients. By proposing the authentic subjective experience view, we attempt to provide an alternative view to the general consideration that the patients suffer a diminished subjective experience. This view can contribute to a larger clinical framework that gives a positive meaning to the subjective experience of patients with AD. Furthermore, several clinical and empirical implications can be drawn from the authentic subjective experience view, including the possibility to evaluate behavioral correlates of the subjective experience in AD.},

	abstract = {Mutations of calreticulin (CALRm) define a subtype of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). We studied the biological and genetic features of CALR-mutated essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis patients. In most cases, CALRm were found in granulocytes, monocytes, B and NK cells, but also in T cells. However, the type 1 CALRm spreads more easily than the type 2 CALRm in lymphoid cells. The CALRm were also associated with an early clonal dominance at the level of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) with no significant increase during granulo/monocytic differentiation in most cases. Moreover, we found that half of type 2 CALRm patients harbors some homozygous progenitors. Those patients were associated with a higher clonal dominance during granulo/monocytic differentiation than patients with only heterozygous type 2 CALRm progenitors. When associated mutations were present, CALRm were the first genetic event suggesting that they are both the initiating and phenotypic event. In blood, type 1 CALRm led to a greater increased number of all types of progenitors compared with the type 2 CALRm. However, both types of CALRm induced an increase in megakaryocytic progenitors associated with a ruxolitinib-sensitive independent growth and with a mild constitutive signaling in megakaryocytes. At the transcriptional level, type 1 CALRm seems to deregulate more pathways than the type 2 CALRm in megakaryocytes. Altogether, our results show that CALRm modify both the HSPC and megakaryocyte biology with a stronger effect for type 1 than for type 2 CALRm.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied the independent and joint effects of the genes encoding alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in Parkinson disease (PD) as part of a large meta-analysis of individual data from case-control studies participating in the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease (GEO-PD) consortium.
METHODS: Participants of Caucasian ancestry were genotyped for a total of 4 SNCA (rs2583988, rs181489, rs356219, rs11931074) and 2 MAPT (rs1052553, rs242557) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). Individual and joint effects of SNCA and MAPT SNPs were investigated using fixed- and random-effects logistic regression models. Interactions were studied on both a multiplicative and an additive scale, and using a case-control and case-only approach.
RESULTS: Fifteen GEO-PD sites contributed a total of 5,302 cases and 4,161 controls. All 4 SNCA SNPs and the MAPT H1-haplotype-defining SNP (rs1052553) displayed a highly significant marginal association with PD at the significance level adjusted for multiple comparisons. For SNCA, the strongest associations were observed for SNPs located at the 3' end of the gene. There was no evidence of statistical interaction between any of the 4 SNCA SNPs and rs1052553 or rs242557, neither on the multiplicative nor on the additive scale.
INTERPRETATION: This study confirms the association between PD and both SNCA SNPs and the H1 MAPT haplotype. It shows, based on a variety of approaches, that the joint action of variants in these 2 loci is consistent with independent effects of the genes without additional interacting effects.},

Methods: We investigated the neural correlates of these three memory processes in a large cohort study. The Memento cohort enrolled 2323 outpatients presenting either with subjective cognitive decline or mild cognitive impairment who underwent cognitive, structural MRI and, for a subset, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography evaluations.
Results: Encoding was associated with a network including parietal and temporal cortices; storage was mainly associated with entorhinal and parahippocampal regions, bilaterally; retrieval was associated with a widespread network encompassing frontal regions.
Discussion: The neural correlates of episodic memory processes can be assessed in large and standardized cohorts of patients at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Their relation to pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease remains to be studied.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the epidemiology of the prodromal and mild stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients who are eligible for clinical trials with disease-modifying therapies.
SETTINGS: We analysed two large complementary databases to study the incidence and characteristics of this population on a nationwide scope in France from 2014 to 2018. The National Alzheimer Database contains data from 357 memory centres and 90 private neurologists. Data from 2014 to 2018 have been analysed.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients, 50-85 years old, diagnosed with AD who had an Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score of ≥20 were included. We excluded patients with mixed and non-AD neurocognitive disorders.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Descriptive statistics of the population of interest was the primary measure.
RESULTS: In the National Alzheimer Database, 550 198 patients were assessed. Among them, 72 174 (13.1\%) were diagnosed with AD and had an MMSE ≥20. Using corrections for specificity of clinical diagnosis of AD, we estimated that about 50 000 (9.1\%) had a prodromal or mild AD. In the combined electronic clinical records database of 11 French expert memory centres, a diagnosis of prodromal or mild AD, certified by the use of cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, could be established in 195 (1.3\%) out of 14 596 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: AD was not frequently diagnosed at a prodromal or mild dementia stage in France in 2014 to 2018. Diagnosis rarely relied on a pathophysiological marker even in expert memory centres. National databases will be valuable to monitor early stage AD diagnosis efficacy in memory centres when a disease-modifying treatment becomes available.},

This study sought to identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes from 25,580 Alzheimer's cases and 48,466 controls.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8 (TP53INP1, p = 1.4×10-6) and 14 (IGHV1-67 p = 7.9×10-8) which indexed novel susceptibility loci.
SIGNIFICANCE: The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and the immune system and add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) is a powerful tool to uncover proteome modifications potentially related to different physiological or pathological conditions. Basically, this technique is based on the separation of proteins according to their isoelectric point in a first step, and secondly according to their molecular weights by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In this report an optimized sample preparation protocol for little amount of human post-mortem and mouse brain tissue is described. This method enables to perform both two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mini 2DE immunoblotting. The combination of these approaches allows one to not only find new proteins and/or protein modifications in their expression thanks to its compatibility with mass spectrometry detection, but also a new insight into markers validation. Thus, mini-2DE coupled to western blotting permits to identify and validate post-translational modifications, proteins catabolism and provides a qualitative comparison among different conditions and/or treatments. Herein, we provide a method to study components of protein aggregates found in AD and Lewy body dementia such as the amyloid-beta peptide and the alpha-synuclein. Our method can thus be adapted for the analysis of the proteome and insoluble proteins extract from human brain tissue and mice models too. In parallel, it may provide useful information for the study of molecular and cellular pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases as well as potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a complex disorder characterised by a broad range of clinical manifestations, differential pathological signatures, and genetic variability. Mutations in three genes-MAPT, GRN, and C9orf72--have been associated with FTD. We sought to identify novel genetic risk loci associated with the disorder.
METHODS: We did a two-stage genome-wide association study on clinical FTD, analysing samples from 3526 patients with FTD and 9402 healthy controls. To reduce genetic heterogeneity, all participants were of European ancestry. In the discovery phase (samples from 2154 patients with FTD and 4308 controls), we did separate association analyses for each FTD subtype (behavioural variant FTD, semantic dementia, progressive non-fluent aphasia, and FTD overlapping with motor neuron disease [FTD-MND]), followed by a meta-analysis of the entire dataset. We carried forward replication of the novel suggestive loci in an independent sample series (samples from 1372 patients and 5094 controls) and then did joint phase and brain expression and methylation quantitative trait loci analyses for the associated (p{\textless}5 × 10(-8)) single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
FINDINGS: We identified novel associations exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold (p{\textless}5 × 10(-8)). Combined (joint) analyses of discovery and replication phases showed genome-wide significant association at 6p21.3, HLA locus (immune system), for rs9268877 (p=1·05 × 10(-8); odds ratio=1·204 [95\% CI 1·11-1·30]), rs9268856 (p=5·51 × 10(-9); 0·809 [0·76-0·86]) and rs1980493 (p value=1·57 × 10(-8), 0·775 [0·69-0·86]) in the entire cohort. We also identified a potential novel locus at 11q14, encompassing RAB38/CTSC (the transcripts of which are related to lysosomal biology), for the behavioural FTD subtype for which joint analyses showed suggestive association for rs302668 (p=2·44 × 10(-7); 0·814 [0·71-0·92]). Analysis of expression and methylation quantitative trait loci data suggested that these loci might affect expression and methylation in cis.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that immune system processes (link to 6p21.3) and possibly lysosomal and autophagy pathways (link to 11q14) are potentially involved in FTD. Our findings need to be replicated to better define the association of the newly identified loci with disease and to shed light on the pathomechanisms contributing to FTD.

	abstract = {Tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), fronto-temporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, are neurodegenerative disorders neuropathologically characterized by the presence of intraneuronal fibrillary inclusions composed of abnormally phosphorylated-Tau. Tau protein is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP) involved in microtubules polymerization and stabilization. So far, the molecular mechanisms underlying Tau-mediated cellular toxicity remain elusive. To address the determinants of Tau neurotoxicity, we previously performed a misexpression screening in a Drosophila tauopathy model to identify genetic modifiers of the human Tau-induced neurodegeneration. We identified several components of the actin network as modifiers of Tau V337M-induced neurodegeneration, i.e. Filamin-A, Myosin VI, Paxillin and Transgelin-3. The aim of this study was to assess whether these genetic interactions were associated with a colocalization of the proteins (i) in the brains of patients with Tau pathologies, and (ii) in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing human mutant Tau. We found that Filamin-A and Myosin VI indeed colocalize with fibrillary Tau protein in AD and FTDP-17 and in Thy-Tau22 transgenic mice.},

	abstract = {Mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are an important cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitin and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43)-positive pathology. The clinical presentation associated with GRN mutations is heterogeneous and may include clinical probable Alzheimer's disease. All GRN mutations identified thus far cause disease through a uniform disease mechanism, i.e. the loss of functional GRN or haploinsufficiency. To determine if expression of GRN in plasma could predict GRN mutation status and could be used as a biological marker, we optimized a GRN ELISA and studied plasma samples of a consecutive clinical FTLD series of 219 patients, 70 control individuals, 72 early-onset probable Alzheimer's disease patients and nine symptomatic and 18 asymptomatic relatives of GRN mutation families. All FTLD patients with GRN loss-of-function mutations showed significantly reduced levels of GRN in plasma to about one third of the levels observed in non-GRN carriers and control individuals (P {\textless} 0.001). No overlap in distributions of GRN levels was observed between the eight GRN loss-of-function mutation carriers (range: 53-94 ng/ml) and 191 non-GRN mutation carriers (range: 115-386 ng/ml). Similar low levels of GRN were identified in asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. Importantly, ELISA analyses also identified one probable Alzheimer's disease patient (1.4\%) carrying a loss-of-function mutation in GRN. Biochemical analyses further showed that the GRN ELISA only detects full-length GRN, no intermediate granulin fragments. This study demonstrates that using a GRN ELISA in plasma, pathogenic GRN mutations can be accurately detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. The approximately 75\% reduction in full-length GRN, suggests an unbalanced GRN metabolism in loss-of-function mutation carriers whereby more GRN is processed into granulins. We propose that plasma GRN levels could be used as a reliable and inexpensive tool to identify all GRN mutation carriers in early-onset dementia populations and asymptomatic at-risk individuals.},

This null association was also detected between LTL and frontotemporal dementia in the European population. However, we found that an indirect effect of LTL on ALS might be mediated by low density lipoprotein (LDL) or total cholesterol (TC) in the European population. These results were robust against extensive sensitivity analyses. Overall, our MR study did not support the direct causal association between LTL and the ALS risk in neither population, but provided suggestive evidence for the mediation role of LDL or TC on the influence of LTL and ALS in the European population.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease is characterized by cognitive alterations, cerebral atrophy and neuropathological lesions including neuronal loss, accumulation of misfolded and aggregated β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) and tau proteins. Iatrogenic induction of Aβ is suspected in patients exposed to pituitary-derived hormones, dural grafts, or surgical instruments, presumably contaminated with Aβ. Induction of Aβ and tau lesions has been demonstrated in transgenic mice after contamination with Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates, with very limited functional consequences. Unlike rodents, primates naturally express Aβ or tau under normal conditions and attempts to transmit Alzheimer pathology to primates have been made for decades. However, none of earlier studies performed any detailed functional assessments. For the first time we demonstrate long term memory and learning impairments in a non-human primate (Microcebus murinus) following intracerebral injections with Alzheimer human brain extracts. Animals inoculated with Alzheimer brain homogenates displayed progressive cognitive impairments (clinical tests assessing cognitive and motor functions), modifications of neuronal activity (detected by electroencephalography), widespread and progressive cerebral atrophy (in vivo MRI assessing cerebral volume loss using automated voxel-based analysis), neuronal loss in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (post mortem stereology). They displayed parenchymal and vascular Aβ depositions and tau lesions for some of them, in regions close to the inoculation sites. Although these lesions were sparse, they were never detected in control animals. Tau-positive animals had the lowest performances in a memory task and displayed the greatest neuronal loss. Our study is timely and important as it is the first one to highlight neuronal and clinical dysfunction following inoculation of Alzheimer's disease brain homogenates in a primate. Clinical signs in a chronic disease such as Alzheimer take a long time to be detectable. Documentation of clinical deterioration and/or dysfunction following intracerebral inoculations with Alzheimer human brain extracts could lead to important new insights about Alzheimer initiation processes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have previously shown delayed poststroke dementia in elderly (≥75 years old) stroke survivors is associated with medial temporal lobe atrophy; however, the basis of the structural and functional changes is unknown.
METHODS: Using 3-dimensional stereological methods, we quantified hippocampal pyramidal neuronal volumes and densities in a total of 95 postmortem samples from demented and nondemented poststroke survivors within our prospective Cognitive Function after Stroke study and subjects pathologically diagnosed with vascular dementia, Alzheimer disease, and mixed Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia syndrome.
RESULTS: Hippocampal CA1 but not CA2 subfield neuron density was affected in poststroke, Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, and mixed dementia groups relative to control subjects (P{\textless}0.05). Neuronal volume was reduced in the poststroke dementia relative to poststroke nondemented group in both CA1 and CA2, although there were no apparent differences in neuronal density. Poststroke nondemented neuronal volumes were similar to control subjects but greater than in all dementias (P{\textless}0.05). Neuronal volumes positively correlated with global cognitive function and memory function in both CA1 and CA2 in poststroke subjects (P{\textless}0.01). Degrees of neuronal atrophy and loss were similar in the poststroke dementia and vascular dementia groups. However, in the entorhinal cortex layer V, neuronal volumes were only impaired in the mixed and Alzheimer disease groups (P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest hippocampal neuronal atrophy is an important substrate for dementia in both cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal atrophy is widely recognized in Alzheimer disease (AD). Whether neurons within hippocampal subfields are similarly affected in other aging-related dementias, particularly after stroke, remains an open question. We investigated hippocampal CA3 and CA4 pyramidal neuron volumes and densities using 3-dimensional stereologic techniques in postmortem samples from a total of 67 subjects: poststoke demented (PSD; n = 11), nondemented stroke survivors (PSND) and PSD patients from the CogFAST (Cognitive Function After Stroke) cohort (n = 13), elderly controls (n = 12), and subjects diagnosed as having vascular dementia (n = 11), AD (n = 10), and mixed AD and vascular dementia (n = 10). We found that CA3 and CA4 neuron volumes were reduced in PSD samples compared with those in PSND samples. The CA3 and CA4 neuron volumes were positively correlated with poststroke global cognitive function but were not associated with the burden of AD pathology. There were no differences in total neuron densities in either subfield in any of the groups studied. Our results indicate that selective reductions in CA4 and to a lesser extent CA3 neuron volumes may be related to post stroke cognitive impairment and aging-related dementias. These data suggest that CA4 neurons are vulnerable to disease processes and support our previous finding that a reduction in hippocampal neuron volume predominantly reflects vascular mechanisms as contributing to dementia after stroke.},

In order to determine the genetic contribution of CHMP2B mutations in FTLD and FTLD-MND families, we analyzed the CHMP2B gene in 198 French probands with familial FTLD and FTLD-MND. One CHMP2B missense variant was found in a proband with familial FTLD (0.8\%). The pathogenic role of CHMP2B missense variants is unclear, however the pSer194Leu substitution, located in the C-terminal domain of the protein, was predicted to alter the stability of the protein by in silico analyses. We conclude that CHMP2B mutations represent a rare cause of familial FTLD and they are not implicated in familial FTLD-MND in French patients.

To clarify this issue, we examined the evolution of semantic memory impairment in 24 Alzheimer's disease patients by means of a longitudinal study. We used two semantic tasks, one explicit and the other implicit, to evaluate the integrity of the same concepts. The explicit task was a semantic knowledge task composed of naming and questions, involving superordinate and attribute knowledge of concepts. The implicit task, a lexical decision task, assessed semantic priming and allowed a very pure measurement of semantic memory. In this task, related pairs of words had coordinate (e.g. "tiger-lion") or attribute ("tiger-stripe") relationships. In the coordinate relation between two words, the semantic priming performances were at first paradoxical: they increased abnormally (hyperpriming) before falling down, whereas in the attribute condition, the priming effects were first normal and then started to decrease in the final sessions (hypopriming). Compared with the semantic knowledge performance, these apparently disconcerting results reflect a coherent pattern of semantic memory degradation in Alzheimer's disease that is a progressive deterioration starting with specific attribute information. The data reveal in an astonishing yet striking manner the dynamic semantic memory degradation in Alzheimer's disease through the apparently paradoxical semantic priming effects.},

	abstract = {Pyk2 is a Ca2+-activated non-receptor tyrosine kinase enriched in forebrain neurons and involved in synaptic regulation. Human genetic studies associated PTK2B, the gene coding Pyk2, with risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that Pyk2 is important for hippocampal function, plasticity, and spine structure. However, its potential role in AD is unknown. To address this question we used human brain samples and 5XFAD mice, an amyloid mouse model of AD expressing mutated human amyloid precursor protein and presenilin1. In the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice and in human AD patients' cortex and hippocampus, Pyk2 total levels were normal. However, Pyk2 Tyr-402 phosphorylation levels, reflecting its autophosphorylation-dependent activity, were reduced in 5XFAD mice at 8 months of age but not 3 months. We crossed these mice with Pyk2-/- mice to generate 5XFAD animals devoid of Pyk2. At 8 months the phenotype of 5XFAD x Pyk2-/- double mutant mice was not different from that of 5XFAD. In contrast, overexpression of Pyk2 in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice, using adeno-associated virus, rescued autophosphorylated Pyk2 levels and improved synaptic markers and performance in several behavioral tasks. Both Pyk2-/- and 5XFAD mice showed an increase of potentially neurotoxic Src cleavage product, which was rescued by Pyk2 overexpression. Manipulating Pyk2 levels had only minor effects on Aβ plaques, which were slightly decreased in hippocampus CA3 region of double mutant mice and increased following overexpression. Our results show that Pyk2 is not essential for the pathogenic effects of human amyloidogenic mutations in the 5XFAD mouse model. However, the slight decrease in plaque number observed in these mice in the absence of Pyk2 and their increase following Pyk2 overexpression suggest a contribution of this kinase in plaque formation. Importantly, a decreased function of Pyk2 was observed in 5XFAD mice, indicated by its decreased autophosphorylation and associated Src alterations. Overcoming this deficit by Pyk2 overexpression improved the behavioral and molecular phenotype of 5XFAD mice. Thus, our results in a mouse model of AD suggest that Pyk2 impairment may play a role in the symptoms of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Secondary prevention measures in patients with cerebral ischemia or coronary heart disease (CHD) consist of vascular risk factors management and antithrombotic therapy. The aim of this study was to compare how secondary prevention measures are applied in practice between patients with a history of CHD or cerebral ischemia.
METHOD: We compared vascular risk factors management and antithrombotic therapy between patients with a history of CHD and patients with a history of cerebral ischemia that occurred 2 months to 6 years earlier. Whether patients were properly treated or not was determined by a comparison between their current treatments and European guidelines for stroke and CHD management.
RESULTS: We included 107 consecutive patients with a history of cerebral ischemia and 85 consecutive patients with a history of CHD. We found that: (i). most patients did not receive an appropriate secondary prevention in both groups: 76 of 107 patients with previous cerebral ischemia (71 \%) and 73 of 85 patients with CHD (85.9 \%); (ii). identification of risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking, did not differ between both groups, but arterial hypertension was more frequent in CHD patients; (iii). an inappropriate management of risk factors was more frequent in patients with TIA vs. ischemic stroke, and angina pectoris vs. myocardial infarction; (iv). arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were the 2 more frequent risk factors that were not properly treated; (v). more than half diabetic patients had hyperglycemia {\textgreater} or= 126 mg/dl in both groups; (vi). patients with previous CHD had twice more frequently stopped smoking than those with cerebral ischemia.
CONCLUSION: Many patients were not properly treated in both groups, and differences between practice and guidelines were more frequent in the CHD group, where guidelines are more strict.},

Few studies, however, have assessed the combined association of these changes on the severity of future cognitive decline. In the prospective population-based 3C-Dijon MRI study, 1701 non-demented participants aged 65 to 80 years at entry had a brain MRI. Information on WML, hippocampal volumes, SBI presence, and brain parenchymal fraction were obtained. At 4-year follow-up, participants were screened for cognitive decline and dementia. Severity of cognitive decline was defined as none, moderate, or severe calculated from neuropsychological test performance change. The relation between brain MRI markers and longitudinal change in cognition was studied using polytomous logistic regression and multiple linear regression models controlling for potential confounders. Two-by-two interactions were tested including with the apolipoprotein E genotype. At follow-up, 46 participants showed severe cognitive deterioration and 224 participants showed moderate cognitive deterioration. In multivariable analyses, risk of severe cognitive deterioration as well as the cognitive decline rate were significantly increased in participants with higher WML volume (p{\textless} 0.01) and smaller hippocampal volume (p{\textless} 0.01). The results suggested that WML and hippocampal volumes had a cumulative effect on the future level of cognitive decline. The APOE genotype was found to be an effect modifier of this association. Vascular brain changes and degenerative processes coexist in normal older individuals. The co-occurrence of degenerative and non-degenerative pathologies could strongly affect the course of dementia expression.},

We analyzed 39 SNPs in ESR1 and 5 SNPs in ESR2 in a French case-control study of sporadic AD (1007 cases/647 controls). Individuals carrying the minor allele of rs7450824 had a lower risk of AD than homozygous subjects for the major allele (age, gender, and APOE ε4 allele adjusted odds ratio = 0.71 [0.57-0.89], p = 0.003). However, this association did not resist Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (p-threshold {\textless} 0.001). Consistently, no significant association could be detected when considering age of onset. We also tested for possible interactions between the ESR SNPs and APOE status (ε4 allele) or gender but no significant interaction could be observed. Even after stratifying the sample on APOE status or gender, no significant association with AD risk could be detected. Finally, we searched for potential gene-gene interactions between ESR1 and ESR2 SNPs but no significant interaction could be detected. Our results reinforce the notion that SNPs in the ESR1 or ESR2 genes do not seem to play a major role in the genetic susceptibility of AD.},

A particularly high Tau level may indicate AD but may also be associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In such situations little is known about the distribution of differential diagnoses.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to describe the different diagnoses encountered in clinical practice for patients with dementia and CSF Tau levels over 1000 pg/ml. We studied the p-Tau/Tau ratio to specify its ability to distinguish AD from CJD.
METHODS: Patients (n = 202) with CSF Tau levels over 1000 pg/ml were recruited in three memory clinics in France. All diagnoses were made using the same diagnostic procedure and criteria.
RESULTS: Patients were diagnosed with AD (n = 148, 73.2\%), mixed dementia (n = 38, 18.8\%), CJD, vascular dementia (n = 4, 2.0\% for each), Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia (n = 3, 1.5\% for each). Dispersion of CSF Tau levels clearly showed an overlap between all diagnoses. Using the p-Tau/Tau ratio suggestive of CJD ({\textless}0.075), all CJD patients were correctly categorized and only two AD patients were miscategorized. This ratio was highly associated with CJD compared to AD (p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that in clinical practice, extremely high CSF Tau levels are mainly related to diagnosis of AD. CJD patients represent a minority. Our results support a sequential interpretation algorithm for CSF biomarkers in dementia. High CSF Tau levels should alert clinicians to check the p-Tau/Tau ratio to consider a probable diagnosis of CJD.},

Here, we have developed a novel functional genomics methodology to express common locus haplotypes to assess functional differences. DNA recombination was used to engineer 5 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) to each express a different haplotype of the NCSTN locus. Each NCSTN-BAC was delivered to knockout nicastrin (Ncstn(-/-)) cells and clonal NCSTN-BAC(+)/Ncstn(-/-) cell lines were created for functional analyses. We showed that all NCSTN-BAC haplotypes expressed nicastrin protein and rescued γ-secretase activity and amyloid beta (Aβ) production in NCSTN-BAC(+)/Ncstn(-/-) lines. We then showed that genetic variation at the NCSTN locus affected alternative splicing in human postmortem brain tissue. However, there was no robust functional difference between clonal cell lines rescued by each of the 5 different haplotypes. Finally, there was no statistically significant association of NCSTN with disease risk in the 4 cohorts. We therefore conclude that it is unlikely that common variation at the NCSTN locus is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.},

METHODS: One thousand forty participants (417 amnestic MCI, 122 nonamnestic MCI, and 501 AD) from the Biomarker of AmyLoïd pepTide and AlZheimer's diseAse Risk multicenter prospective study with cognition, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging assessments were included.
RESULTS: Plasma Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 were lower in AD (36.9 [11.7] and 263 [80] pg/mL) than in amnestic MCI (38.2 [11.9] and 269 [68] pg/mL) than in nonamnestic MCI (39.7 [10.5] and 272 [52] pg/mL), respectively (P = .01 for overall difference between groups for Aβ1-42 and P = .04 for Aβ1-40). Globally, plasma Aβ1-42 correlated with age, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE ε4 allele. Plasma Aβ1-42 correlated with all CSF biomarkers in MCI but only with CSF Aβ42 in AD.
DISCUSSION: Plasma Aβ was associated with cognitive status and CSF biomarkers, suggesting the interest of plasma amyloid biomarkers for diagnosis purpose.},

Clinical and neuropathological diagnoses in 112 demented subjects comprised dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Mixed dementia (mostly AD-DLB) and vascular dementia (VaD). Of these, 12 DLB subjects had no recorded unexpected falls in life and therefore no evidence of concomitant autonomic dysfunction. A further 17 subjects were assessed as aging controls without significant pathology or signs of autonomic dysfunction. We quantified brain vascular pathological changes and determined severities of neurodegenerative lesions including α-synuclein pathology. We found moderate-severe vascular changes and high-vascular pathology scores (P {\textless} 0.01) in all neurodegenerative dementias and as expected in VaD compared to similar age controls. Arteriolosclerosis, perivascular spacing and microinfarcts were frequent in the basal ganglia and frontal white matter (WM) across all dementias, whereas small infarcts ({\textless}5 mm) were restricted to VaD. In a sub-set of demented subjects, we found that vascular pathology scores were correlated with WM hyperintensity volumes determined by MRI in life (P {\textless} 0.02). Sclerotic index values were increased by {\textasciitilde}50\% in both the WM and neocortex in all dementias compared to similar age controls. We found no evidence for increased α-synuclein deposition in subjects with autonomic dysfunction. Our findings suggest greater SVD pathological changes occur in the elderly diagnosed with neurodegenerative dementias including DLB and who develop autonomic dysfunction. SVD changes may not necessarily manifest in clinically overt symptoms but they likely confound motor or cognitive dysfunction. We propose dysautonomia promotes chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to impact upon aging-related neurodegenerative disorders and characterize their end-stage clinical syndromes.},

RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of the demented subjects did not seek advice for their cognitive problems and only 31\% consulted a specialist. Consultation for primary care was principally dependent on the subjects' own awareness of the cognitive disorder and on their age. Factors associated with consultation for secondary care were younger age, higher education level, higher instrumental activities of daily living disability and awareness of the cognitive disorder by the subject, all of which predicted more frequent consultation. The level of cognitive performance had only a slight influence on primary care and none on secondary care.
CONCLUSION: The failure to see a physician due to dementia, especially secondary-care practitioners, is frequent in the community, particularly in the oldest subjects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) have impaired theory of mind (ToM). However, ToM involves a variety of processes, such as understanding a person's intentions ("cognitive" ToM) and emotional states ("affective" ToM). The objectives of the present study were to characterize ToM disorders in TLE patients, identify patients at risk of ToM disorders, and study the relationships between psychobehavioral and quality of life factors and ToM disorders.
METHOD: Fifty TLE patients and 50 controls performed ToM tasks assessing their understanding of verbal clumsiness (faux pas), sarcastic remarks, and mentalistic actions. Demographic, cognitive, and psychobehavioral data, and (for TLE patients) clinical and quality of life factors, were recorded.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, TLE patients showed impairments in all ToM tasks: 84\% misunderstood faux pas, and around 50\% misunderstood sarcasm. A long duration of epilepsy and young age at onset were risk factors for ToM impairments. In TLE patients, ToM impairments were associated with impaired empathy and anhedonia. Their affective states were less positively and more negatively valenced than in controls. Low positive affectivity was predictive of greater cognitive and affective ToM impairments for the faux pas task, and high negative affectivity was predictive of greater cognitive ToM abilities for the sarcasm task. The lack of social support was correlated with impaired ToM but was not a predictive factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive and affective ToM processes are impaired in TLE patients. Impaired ToM has an impact on empathy abilities and is related to affective disturbances in TLE patients.},

	abstract = {Although patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) are known to have theory of mind (ToM) impairments, the latter's neural functional bases have yet to be explored. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to gain insights into the neural dysfunction associated with ToM impairments in patients with mTLE. Twenty-five patients (12 and 13 with right and left mTLE, respectively) and 25 healthy controls performed the "animated shapes" task during fMRI. This complex ToM task requires both explicit reasoning about mental states and implicit processing of information on biological motion and action. The animated shapes evoke both ToM and non-ToM interaction perception, and the corresponding neural activation patterns were compared. Behavioral performance (i.e. categorization of the interactions) was also recorded. Relative to healthy controls, both patients with right and left mTLE were impaired in categorizing ToM interactions. The fMRI results showed that both patients with right and left mTLE had less intense neural activation (relative to controls) in regions involved in the implicit component of ToM processes (i.e. the fusiform gyrus in patients with right mTLE and the supplementary motor area in patients with left mTLE). In patients with right mTLE, we also observed more intense activation (relative to controls) in regions involved in the explicit component of ToM processes (i.e. the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex); age at onset of epilepsy also mediated activation in regions involved in the explicit component (i.e. the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the temporoparietal junction). Patients with left mTLE displayed greater activation of the contralateral mesial regions (relative to controls); we speculate that this may correspond to the deployment of a compensatory mechanism. This study provides insights into the disturbances of the implicit/explicit ToM neural network in patients with mTLE. These impairments in the ToM neural network depend on clinical characteristics, such as the laterality (right or left mTLE) and the age at onset of epilepsy.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The present study sought to characterize and predict the recognition of emotional stimuli (presented in a visual or auditory modality) by patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
METHOD: Fifty TLE patients and 50 matched controls performed two emotion recognition tasks (emotional faces and emotional bursts). Neutral stimuli were also presented, and emotional biases were monitored by analyzing errors. Demographic, cognitive, psychobehavioral and (in TLE patients only) clinical and quality of life data were also recorded.
RESULTS: Compared with controls, TLE patients were impaired in the recognition of fear expressions in both visual and auditory modality tasks. However, impairments in the two channels were not always concomitant on the individual level. In the visual modality, recognition of disgust and neutral expressions was significantly worse in TLE patients. In the auditory modality, nonsignificant trends toward poor recognition of disgust and neutral expressions were observed. Negative biases were noted in TLE patients; expressions of fear (faces and bursts) were more frequently misinterpreted as disgust, and neutral facial expressions were more frequently misinterpreted as sadness. Impairments in the recognition of facial fear were less pronounced in left TLE patients who (according to structural magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) did not have any brain lesions. In TLE patients, low levels of social support (a quality of life parameter) were associated with worse recognition of facial disgust, and higher levels of apathy were associated with better recognition of neutral faces.
CONCLUSIONS: TLE patients are impaired in some aspects of emotion recognition with both visual and auditory stimuli, although the differential impact of TLE on these modalities requires further research. These emotional impairments are related to quality of life and psychobehavioral parameters.},

Prestroke dementia is frequent: its influence on survival in stroke patients has never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of prestroke dementia on early and delayed mortality rate after stroke. In a cohort of 202 consecutive stroke patients aged {\textgreater}or= 40 years admitted between November 1995 and May 1996 in a primary care center, the prevalence of prestroke dementia was determined using the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) with a cut-off of 104. Patients were followed-up for 3 years. Statistics were performed using life-table methods. Of 202 patients, 33 had prestroke dementia. Of 142 survivors at month-6, 44 were demented, of them 15 having prestroke and 29 new-onset post-stroke dementia. No patient was lost to follow-up. The risk of death at month-6 was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 2.7; 95 \% CI: 1.6-4.8). However, independent predictors of early death were age, severity of the deficit at admission, type and etiology of stroke. The risk of delayed death was higher in patients with prestroke dementia (RR 4.97; 95 \% CI: 1.76-13.98) as in patients with new-onset post-stroke dementia (RR 6.24; 95 \% CI: 2.67-14.57), compared with non-demented patients. The mortality rate did not differ between patients with prestroke and new-onset post-stroke dementia. Dementia at month-6 was an independent predictor of delayed death (RR 5.7; 95 \% CI: 2.4-13.4), with age and stroke recurrence. Causes of death did not differ between demented and non-demented patients. Dementia adversely influences vital outcome in stroke patients, perhaps partly because the therapeutic approach differs between demented and non-demented patients.},

	abstract = {In humans, iatrogenic transmission of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ)-amyloidosis is suspected following inoculation of pituitary-derived hormones or dural grafts presumably contaminated with Aβ proteins as well as after cerebral surgeries. Experimentally, intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenate extracts containing misfolded Aβ can seed Aβ deposition in transgenic mouse models of amyloidosis or in non-human primates. The transmission of cerebral Aβ is governed by the host and by the inoculated samples. It is critical to better characterize the propensities of different hosts to develop Aβ deposition after contamination by an Aβ-positive sample as well as to better assess which biological samples can transmit this lesion. Aβ precursor protein (huAPPwt) mice express humanized non-mutated forms of Aβ precursor protein and do not spontaneously develop Aβ or amyloid deposits. We found that inoculation of Aβ-positive brain extracts from Alzheimer patients in these mice leads to a sparse Aβ deposition close to the alveus 18 months post-inoculation. However, it does not induce cortical or hippocampal Aβ deposition. Secondary inoculation of apparently amyloid deposit-free hippocampal extracts from these huAPPwt mice to APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse models of amyloidosis enhanced Aβ deposition in the alveus 9 months post-inoculation. This suggests that Aβ seeds issued from human brain samples can persist in furtive forms in brain tissues while maintaining their ability to foster Aβ deposition in receptive hosts that overexpress endogenous Aβ. This work emphasizes the need for high-level preventive measures, especially in the context of neurosurgery, to prevent the risk of iatrogenic transmission of Aβ lesions from samples with sparse amyloid markers.},

METHODS: MRIs (including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR), post-contrast T1-weighted sequences) were performed every week following PML diagnosis in 11 consecutive NTZ-PML patients. PML expansion, punctate lesions, contrast-enhancement, and mass-effect/edema were evaluated on each MRI sequence, following NTZ discontinuation.
RESULTS: PML-IRIS occurred from 26 to 89 days after NTZ discontinuation. MRI changes prior to early PML-IRIS appeared significantly more pronounced using DWI compared to T2-FLAIR imaging (p {\textless} 0.003). Two DWI features (marked PML expansion, punctate lesions) systematically preceded contrast-enhancement.
CONCLUSION: Subtle changes may occur on DWI preceding contrast-enhancement.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of the punctate pattern (PP) for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).
METHODS: A cohort of 20 consecutive patients with PML, related to natalizumab (NTZ) (n = 14) or not (n = 6), underwent 3T MRI (147 MRI examinations). MRI was available at presymptomatic (n = 9 patients), symptomatic (n = 15), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), and chronic stages (n = 20). A pathologic control group of patients without PML (n = 80), with clinically definitive multiple sclerosis or a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of CNS demyelination, underwent the same MRI protocol. Number and appearance of punctate lesions were assessed by 3 blinded readers using T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and postcontrast T1-weighted images.
RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was good (κ = 0.79) (0.72-0.87). Of the 20 patients with PML, 18 had PP, including the 14 patients with NTZ-PML; none in the pathologic control group. Of the 9 presymptomatic patients with NTZ-PML, PP was observed in 7 (78\% sensitive and 100\% specific). Nonenhancing PP on T2-weighted/FLAIR images was detected in 13 patients with PML, exclusively at the presymptomatic or symptomatic stages (including 7 NTZ-PML), whereas enhancing PP occurred in 16 patients with PML, including 13 of the 14 patients with NTZ-PML at the IRIS stage.
CONCLUSIONS: PP is a highly specific feature of PML and may be the first imaging feature at the presymptomatic stage with potential implications in patient care.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that a PP on MRI accurately identifies patients with NTZ-PML.},

Immunofluorescence labeling showed TMEM240 to be expressed in various areas of the brain, with the highest levels in the hippocampus, isocortex, and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, TMEM240 was detected in the deep nuclei and the cerebellar cortex. The protein was expressed in all three layers of the cortex and various cerebellar neurons. TMEM240 was localized to climbing, mossy, and parallel fiber afferents projecting to Purkinje cells, as shown by co-immunostaining with VGLUT1 and VGLUT2. Co-immunostaining with synaptophysin, post-synaptic fractionation, and confirmatory electron microscopy showed TMEM240 to be localized to the post-synaptic side of synapses near the Purkinje-cell soma. Similar results were obtained in human cerebellar sections. These data suggest that TMEM240 may be involved in the organization of the cerebellar network, particularly in synaptic inputs converging on Purkinje cells.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease causing parkinsonian symptoms. Altered DNA methylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene correlates with the expression changes in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease brains. However, few studies examine the sequences beyond the constitutive promoter.
OBJECTIVES: Because activating different microtubule-associated protein tau gene control regions via methylation might regulate the differential tau expression constituting the specific signatures of individual tauopathies, we compared methylation of a candidate promoter, intron 0.
METHODS: We assessed DNA methylation in the brains of patients with different tauopathies (35 Alzheimer's disease, 10 corticobasal degeneration, and 18 PSP) and 19 controls by intron 0 pyrosequencing. We also evaluated methylation in an independent cohort of 11 PSP cases and 12 controls. Frontal (affected by tau pathology) and occipital (unaffected) cortices were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the initial samples, one CpG island site in intron 0 (CpG1) showed significant hypomethylation in PSP-affected frontal cortices when compared with controls (P = .022). Such hypomethylation was observed in replicate samples, but not in occipital cortices or other tauopathies. PSP and control samples (combining the initial and replicate samples) remained significantly different after adjustment for potential confounding factors (age, H1/H1 diplotype; P = .0005). PSP-affected tissues exhibited microtubule-associated protein tau RNA hyperexpression when compared with controls (P = .004), although no correlation with CpG1 methylation was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study suggests that regions other than the constitutive promoter may be involved in microtubule-associated protein tau gene regulation in tauopathies and that intron 0 hypomethylation may be a specific epigenetic signature of PSP.

METHODS: The ALIGATOR and GSEA algorithms were used in the IGAP data to identify associated functional pathways and correlated gene expression networks in human brain.
RESULTS: ALIGATOR identified an excess of curated biological pathways showing enrichment of association. Enriched areas of biology included the immune response (P = 3.27 × 10(-12) after multiple testing correction for pathways), regulation of endocytosis (P = 1.31 × 10(-11)), cholesterol transport (P = 2.96 × 10(-9)), and proteasome-ubiquitin activity (P = 1.34 × 10(-6)). Correlated gene expression analysis identified four significant network modules, all related to the immune response (corrected P = .002-.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The immune response, regulation of endocytosis, cholesterol transport, and protein ubiquitination represent prime targets for AD therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) generally manifests itself by cognitive or rapidly progressive motor symptoms. An atypical onset or an unusual evolution may delay the diagnosis. Among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sCJD following a post-mortem neuropathological examination at the Neuropathology Centre of Lille, France, those who had presented with atypical cognitive disorders at onset were included in the study. Four patients were included. The first patient (64-years-old) presented early language disorders, later accompanied by apathy and behavioral disorders. The prolonged course suggested a diagnosis of progressive primary aphasia. The second patient (68-years-old) presented with aphasia, apraxia, and ataxia of the right upper limb with parkinsonian syndrome, suggesting corticobasal degeneration. In the two last patients (58- and 61-years-old), the onset was marked by an anxiety-depression syndrome, falls, visual hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and fluctuating cognitive decline. The diagnosis raised was probable Lewy body dementia. The 14.3.3 protein was found in two of the four cases. The clinical elements found may initially suggest focal atrophy or Lewy body dementia. A very rapid clinical deterioration generally suggests sCJD, but in the last case, the evolution was particularly slow. The diagnosis of sCJD must be considered in cases of rapid-onset dementia, even if all of the clinical criteria are not present. The detection of the 14.3.3 protein and multifold increase in total-Tau with normal or slightly increased phosphorylated-Tau in the CSF are additional arguments to reinforce the diagnosis. The post-mortem neuropathological examination is important to confirm the diagnosis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is a growing body of evidence that subtle deficits in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) may be present in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is not clear if there are IADL domains that are consistently affected across patients with MCI. In this systematic review, therefore, we aimed to summarize research results regarding the performance of MCI patients in specific IADL (sub)domains compared with persons who are cognitively normal and/or patients with dementia.
METHODS: The databases PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature in December 2013. Publications from 1999 onward were considered for inclusion. Altogether, 497 articles were retrieved. Reference lists of selected articles were searched for potentially relevant articles. After screening the abstracts of these 497 articles, 37 articles were included in this review.
RESULTS: In 35 studies, IADL deficits (such as problems with medication intake, telephone use, keeping appointments, finding things at home and using everyday technology) were documented in patients with MCI. Financial capacity in patients with MCI was affected in the majority of studies. Effect sizes for group differences between patients with MCI and healthy controls were predominantly moderate to large. Performance-based instruments showed slight advantages (in terms of effect sizes) in detecting group differences in IADL functioning between patients with MCI, patients with Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: IADL requiring higher neuropsychological functioning seem to be most severely affected in patients with MCI. A reliable identification of such deficits is necessary, as patients with MCI with IADL deficits seem to have a higher risk of converting to dementia than patients with MCI without IADL deficits. The use of assessment tools specifically designed and validated for patients with MCI is therefore strongly recommended. Furthermore, the development of performance-based assessment instruments should be intensified, as they allow a valid and reliable assessment of subtle IADL deficits in MCI, even if a proxy is not available. Another important point to consider when designing new scales is the inclusion of technology-associated IADL. Novel instruments for clinical practice should be time-efficient and easy to administer.},

	abstract = {Large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies with diffusion imaging techniques are necessary to test and validate models of white matter neurophysiological processes that change in time, both in healthy and diseased brains. The predictive power of such longitudinal models will always be limited by the reproducibility of repeated measures acquired during different sessions. At present, there is limited quantitative knowledge about the across-session reproducibility of standard diffusion metrics in 3T multi-centric studies on subjects in stable conditions, in particular when using tract based spatial statistics and with elderly people. In this study we implemented a multi-site brain diffusion protocol in 10 clinical 3T MRI sites distributed across 4 countries in Europe (Italy, Germany, France and Greece) using vendor provided sequences from Siemens (Allegra, Trio Tim, Verio, Skyra, Biograph mMR), Philips (Achieva) and GE (HDxt) scanners. We acquired DTI data (2 × 2 × 2 mm(3), b = 700 s/mm(2), 5 b0 and 30 diffusion weighted volumes) of a group of healthy stable elderly subjects (5 subjects per site) in two separate sessions at least a week apart. For each subject and session four scalar diffusion metrics were considered: fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial (AD) diffusivity. The diffusion metrics from multiple subjects and sessions at each site were aligned to their common white matter skeleton using tract-based spatial statistics. The reproducibility at each MRI site was examined by looking at group averages of absolute changes relative to the mean (\%) on various parameters: i) reproducibility of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the b0 images in centrum semiovale, ii) full brain test-retest differences of the diffusion metric maps on the white matter skeleton, iii) reproducibility of the diffusion metrics on atlas-based white matter ROIs on the white matter skeleton. Despite the differences of MRI scanner configurations across sites (vendors, models, RF coils and acquisition sequences) we found good and consistent test-retest reproducibility. White matter b0 SNR reproducibility was on average 7 ± 1\% with no significant MRI site effects. Whole brain analysis resulted in no significant test-retest differences at any of the sites with any of the DTI metrics. The atlas-based ROI analysis showed that the mean reproducibility errors largely remained in the 2-4\% range for FA and AD and 2-6\% for MD and RD, averaged across ROIs. Our results show reproducibility values comparable to those reported in studies using a smaller number of MRI scanners, slightly different DTI protocols and mostly younger populations. We therefore show that the acquisition and analysis protocols used are appropriate for multi-site experimental scenarios.},

	abstract = {Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals). We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia. Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 × 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education.},

METHODS: A total of 185 nondemented elders recruited from either the community or from a memory clinic filled a questionnaire. We searched for item responses associated with medical help seeking, cognitive deficits, and β-amyloidosis.
RESULTS: Compared with community-recruited control subjects (n = 74), help-seeking patients reported a stronger multidomain SCD that was mostly unrelated to the presence of detectable cognitive deficits. Only a few items, notably assessing temporal disorientation, distinguished help-seeking patients with (n = 78) or without (n = 33) memory deficits. Associations between SCD and β-amyloidosis were not restricted to the memory domain and varied across clinical stages.
DISCUSSION: Detailed evaluation of SCD could provide accessible indication of the presence of β-amyloid or cognitive deficits, which might prove useful for early diagnosis and clinical trial enrichment strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathogenic variants in the autosomal dominant genes PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, APOE4 alleles, and rare variants within TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7 contribute to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD). However, sporadic EOAD patients have been insufficiently studied to define the probability of being a carrier of one of these variants.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the proportion of each genetic variation among patients with very young-onset sporadic AD.
METHODS: We first screened PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP in 154 EOAD patients with an onset before 51 years and a negative family history. Among 99 patients with no mutation (NMC), whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. We analyzed the APOE genotype and rare protein-truncating or missense predicted damaging variants of TREM2, SORL1, and ABCA7. Neurological examination and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers were systematically retrieved.
RESULTS: Nineteen (12.3\%) mutation carriers (MC) harbored an APP or PSEN1 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant. Among the NMC, 54/99 carried at least one genetic risk factor, including 9 APOE4/E4 homozygous, 37 APOE4 heterozygous, and 14 with a rare variant in another risk factor gene: 3 SORL1, 4 TREM2, and 9 ABCA7. MC presented an earlier disease onset (p {\textless} 0.0001) and associated neurologic symptoms more frequently (p {\textless} 0.002). All but one patient had at least 2 CSF biomarkers in abnormal ranges.
CONCLUSION: The genetic component of very early sporadic EOAD gathers a substantial proportion of pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant genes and an even higher proportion of patients carrying genetic risk factors, suggesting an oligogenic determinism, even at this range of ages.},

	abstract = {Since the observation of Auguste D. by Alöis Alzheimer, it is an acknowledged fact that writing is one of the cognitive functions that are weakened early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to examine the cognitive nature of this disorder and question the hypothesis of a standard progression (Platel et al., 1993) from lexical to other central and more peripheral processes. A large group of mild to moderate AD patients (n=59) and a group of healthy elderly controls were submitted to an extensive assessment of both the central and peripheral components of writing. A comparison of groups indicated that AD patients performed more poorly than controls on a wide range of writing measures. It revealed a predominantly lexical disorder, but also found evidence of associated disorders located at different stages in the spelling system (phonological route, graphemic buffer, allographic store, graphic motor patterns). A multiple single-case analysis, using a specific methodology, allowed us to delimit individual profiles of agraphia. It revealed a wide variety of agraphia syndromes, including a far from negligible number of patients with selective damage to one of the central or peripheral components, as well as patients with multiple writing impairments. A positive correlation was observed between the severity of the dementia and spelling/writing measures (lexical and allographic). This study does not support the hypothesis of a uniform progression. Rather, it points to heterogeneous profiles of agraphia and suggests that the first signs of writing impairment in AD stem from changes at different points in the broad anatomical network subserving spelling and writing abilities.},

Although these studies reported in detail on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the neighboring genes with the strongest evidence of association with AD, little attention was paid to the rest of the genome. However, complementary statistical and bio-informatics approaches now enable the extraction of pertinent information from other SNPs and/or genes which are only nominally associated with the disease risk. Two different tools (the ALIGATOR and GenGen/KEGG software packages) were used to analyze a large GWAS dataset containing 2,032 AD cases and 5,328 controls. Convergent outputs from the two gene set enrichment approaches suggested an immune system dysfunction in AD. Furthermore, although these statistical approaches did not adopt a priori hypotheses concerning a biological function's putative role in the disease process, genes associated with AD risk were overrepresented in the "Alzheimer's disease" KEGG pathway. In conclusion, a systematic search for biological pathways using GWAS data set seems to comfort the primary causes already suspected but may specifically highlight the importance of the immune system in AD.},

In order to independently assess this association, we performed a meta-analysis of 7,873 AD cases and 13,274 controls of Caucasian origin (from a total of 24 centers in Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amyloid protein precursor (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2) mutations cause autosomal dominant forms of early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD-EOAD). Although these genes were identified in the 1990s, variant classification remains a challenge, highlighting the need to colligate mutations from large series.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We report here a novel update (2012-2016) of the genetic screening of the large AD-EOAD series ascertained across 28 French hospitals from 1993 onwards, bringing the total number of families with identified mutations to n = 170. Families were included when at least two first-degree relatives suffered from early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) with an age of onset (AOO) ≤65 y in two generations. Furthermore, we also screened 129 sporadic cases of Alzheimer disease with an AOO below age 51 (44\% males, mean AOO = 45 ± 2 y). APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 mutations were identified in 53 novel AD-EOAD families. Of the 129 sporadic cases screened, 17 carried a PSEN1 mutation and 1 carried an APP duplication (13\%). Parental DNA was available for 10 sporadic mutation carriers, allowing us to show that the mutation had occurred de novo in each case. Thirteen mutations (12 in PSEN1 and 1 in PSEN2) identified either in familial or in sporadic cases were previously unreported. Of the 53 mutation carriers with available cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, 46 (87\%) had all three CSF biomarkers-total tau protein (Tau), phospho-tau protein (P-Tau), and amyloid β (Aβ)42-in abnormal ranges. No mutation carrier had the three biomarkers in normal ranges. One limitation of this study is the absence of functional assessment of the possibly and probably pathogenic variants, which should help their classification.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a nonnegligible fraction of PSEN1 mutations occurs de novo, which is of high importance for genetic counseling, as PSEN1 mutational screening is currently performed in familial cases only. Among the 90 distinct mutations found in the whole sample of families and isolated cases, definite pathogenicity is currently established for only 77\%, emphasizing the need to pursue the effort to classify variants.},

METHODS: We screened a large cohort of French patients (1,144 ALS, 203 FTD, 168 FTD-ALS, and 109 PSP) for ATXN2 CAG repeat length. We included in our cohort 322 carriers of the C9orf72 expansion (202 ALS, 63 FTD, and 57 FTD-ALS).
RESULTS: We found a significant association with intermediate repeat size (≥29 CAG) in patients with ALS (both familial and sporadic) and, for the first time, in patients with familial FTD-ALS. Of interest, we found the co-occurrence of pathogenic C9orf72 expansion in 23.2\% of ATXN2 intermediate-repeat carriers, all in the FTD-ALS and familial ALS subgroups. In the cohort of C9orf72 carriers, 3.1\% of patients also carried an intermediate ATXN2 repeat length. ATXN2 repeat lengths in patients with PSP and FTD were found to be similar to the controls.
CONCLUSIONS: ATXN2 intermediary repeat length is a strong risk factor for ALS and FTD-ALS. Furthermore, we propose that ATXN2 polyQ expansions could act as a strong modifier of the FTD phenotype in the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion, leading to the development of clinical signs featuring both FTD and ALS.},

A recent study reported a statistically significant interaction between 2 variants of these genes (rs3740473 for SH3PXD2A and rs11244787 for ADAM12) with respect to the risk of developing AD. With a view to replicating this observation, we genotyped the two SNPs in four European case-control cohorts of Caucasian origin (1913 cases and 1468 controls) but were unable to confirm the initial results.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study is a European multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of nilvadipine as a disease course modifying treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a phase III study that will run for a period of 82 weeks with a treatment period of 78 weeks.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Adult patients, males and females over 50 years with mild-to-moderate AD as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria, will be included in the study. It aims to recruit a total of 500 patients with AD; 250 in the nilvadipine group and 250 in the placebo group. Participants will be randomised to receive nilvadipine, an 8 mg overencapsulated, sustained release capsule, or a matching overencapsulated placebo (sugar pill) for a period of 78 weeks of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome measure in this study is the change in cognitive function as assessed by the Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog 12) from baseline to the end of treatment duration (78 weeks). There are two key secondary outcome measures, the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). If a statistically significant effect is seen in the primary outcome, CDR-sb will be considered to be a coprimary end point and only the DAD will contribute to the secondary outcome analysis.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study and all subsequent amendments have received ethical approval within each participating country according to national regulations. Each participant will provide written consent to participate in the study. All participants will remain anonymised throughout and the results of the study will be published in an international peer-reviewed journal.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study reports the findings of the first large-scale Phase III investigator-driven clinical trial to slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease with a dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blocker, nilvadipine. Nilvadipine, licensed to treat hypertension, reduces amyloid production, increases regional cerebral blood flow, and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and anti-tau activity in preclinical studies, properties that could have disease-modifying effects for Alzheimer disease. We aimed to determine if nilvadipine was effective in slowing cognitive decline in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: NILVAD was an 18-month, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial that randomised participants between 15 May 2013 and 13 April 2015. The study was conducted at 23 academic centres in nine European countries. Of 577 participants screened, 511 were eligible and were randomised (258 to placebo, 253 to nilvadipine). Participants took a trial treatment capsule once a day after breakfast for 78 weeks. Participants were aged {\textgreater}50 years, meeting National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's disease Criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA) for diagnosis of probable Alzheimer disease, with a Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) score of ≥12 and {\textless}27. Participants were randomly assigned to 8 mg sustained-release nilvadipine or matched placebo. The a priori defined primary outcome was progression on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subscale-12 (ADAS-Cog 12) in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (n = 498), with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (CDR-sb) as a gated co-primary outcome, eligible to be promoted to primary end point conditional on a significant effect on the ADAS-Cog 12. The analysis set had a mean age of 73 years and was 62\% female. Baseline demographic and Alzheimer disease-specific characteristics were similar between treatment groups, with reported mean of 1.7 years since diagnosis and mean SMMSE of 20.4. The prespecified primary analyses failed to show any treatment benefit for nilvadipine on the co-primary outcome (p = 0.465). Decline from baseline in ADAS-Cog 12 on placebo was 0.79 (95\% CI, -0.07-1.64) at 13 weeks, 6.41 (5.33-7.49) at 52 weeks, and 9.63 (8.33-10.93) at 78 weeks and on nilvadipine was 0.88 (0.02-1.74) at 13 weeks, 5.75 (4.66-6.85) at 52 weeks, and 9.41 (8.09-10.73) at 78 weeks. Exploratory analyses of the planned secondary outcomes showed no substantial effects, including on the CDR-sb or the Disability Assessment for Dementia. Nilvadipine appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Mortality was similar between groups (3 on nilvadipine, 4 on placebo); higher counts of adverse events (AEs) on nilvadipine (1,129 versus 1,030), and serious adverse events (SAEs; 146 versus 101), were observed. There were 14 withdrawals because of AEs. Major limitations of this study were that subjects had established dementia and the likelihood that non-Alzheimer subjects were included because of the lack of biomarker confirmation of the presence of brain amyloid.
CONCLUSIONS: The results do not suggest benefit of nilvadipine as a treatment in a population spanning mild to moderate Alzheimer disease.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the total healthcare costs associated with elderly chronic pain (CP) patients, define cost-related factors in this population, and examine cost evolution over two years.
METHOD: This is an ancillary study from the CP S.AGE subcohort, including non-institutionalized patients aged over 65 suffering from CP. 1190, 1108, 1042, and 950 patients were reviewed with available healthcare data at follow-up visits at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. Healthcare components included medical and paramedical visits, medication prescription, and hospitalization.
RESULT: The mean total cost in the first semester was estimated at {\textless}euro{\textgreater}2548 ± {\textless}euro{\textgreater}8885 per patient. Hospitalization represented the largest cost component (50\%) followed by paramedical care (24\%), medications (21\%), and medical visits (5\%). Significant cost-associated factors were comorbidity (OR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.35-1.64), dependency in daily activities (OR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.39-2.47), probable depression (OR 1.71, 95\% CI 1.09-2.69), permanent pain (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.18-1.86), neuropathic pain (OR 1.94, 95\% CI 1.38-2.73), living alone (OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.16-1.82), chronic back pain (OR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.07-1.71), and vertebral fracture/compression (OR 1.47, 95\% CI 1.08-2.01). Healthcare costs increased significantly by 48\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) during follow-up namely due to hospitalizations. Elevated costs were associated with a higher risk of future hospitalization (OR 1.95, CI 95\% 1.33-2.87).
CONCLUSION: Healthcare costs increased rapidly over time, largely due to hospitalization. Prevention strategies to limit hospitalizations in elderly appear to be the most useful in order to achieve cost savings in the future.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to identify fall predictors in elderly suffering from chronic pain (CP) and to test their applicability among patients with other chronic conditions.
METHODS: 1,379 non-institutionalized patients aged 65 years and older who were suffering from CP (S.AGE CP sub-cohort) were monitored every 6 months for 1 year. Socio-demographic, clinical and pain data and medication use were assessed at baseline for the association with falls in the following year. Falls were assessed retrospectively at each study visit. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify fall predictors. The derived model was applied to two additional S.AGE sub-cohorts: atrial fibrillation (AF) (n = 1,072) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 983).
RESULTS: Four factors predicted falls in the CP sub-cohort: fall history (OR: 4.03, 95 \% CI 2.79-5.82), dependency in daily activities (OR: 1.81, 95 \% CI 1.27-2.59), age ≥75 (OR: 1.53, 95 \% CI 1.04-2.25) and living alone (OR: 1.73, 95 \% CI 1.24-2.41) (Area Under the Curve: AUC = 0.71, 95 \% CI 0.67-0.75). These factors were relevant in AF (AUC = 0.71, 95 \% CI 0.66-0.75) and T2DM (AUC = 0.67, 95 \% CI 0.59-0.73) sub-cohorts. Fall predicted probability in CP, AF and T2DM sub-cohorts increased from 7, 7 and 6 \% in patients with no risk factors to 59, 66 and 45 \% respectively, in those with the four predictors. Fall history was the strongest predictor in the three sub-cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Fall history, dependency in daily activities, age ≥75 and living alone are independent fall predictors in CP, AF and T2DM patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia associated with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that may be inherited by autosomal dominant trait. No major gene has been identified but a locus was mapped on chromosome 9 (9p21.3-p13.3).
METHODS: Ten French families with FTD-MND were tested for linkage to the 9p21.3-p13.3 region. We report extensive mutation screening in 9p-linked families and their clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: We identified six new families with evidence for linkage to the chromosome 9p. Cumulative multipoint LOD score values were positive between markers D9S1121 and D9S301, reaching a peak of 8.0 at marker D9S248. Haplotype reconstruction defined the telomeric boundary at marker AFM218xg11, slightly narrowing the candidate interval. We found no disease-causing mutations by sequencing 29 candidate genes including IFT74 and no copy number variations in the 9p region. The mean age at onset was 57.9 +/- 10.3 years (range, 41-84), with wide heterogeneity within and among families suggesting age-dependant penetrance. The patients presented isolated FTD (32\%), isolated MND (29\%), or both disorders (39\%). The general characteristics of the disease did not differ, except for an older age at onset and shorter disease duration in the 9p-linked compared to nonlinked families. TDP-43-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were found in cortex and spinal cord in 3 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study increases the number of 9p-linked families now reported and shows that this locus may have a major effect on frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and motor neuron disease (MND). Considering our results, the causative gene might be implicated in at least 60\% of the families with FTD-MND disorder.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia occurs in at least 10\% of patients within 1 year after stroke. However, the risk of dementia after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage that accounts for about 15\% of all strokes has not been investigated in prospective studies. We aimed to determine the incidence of dementia and risk factors after an intracerebral haemorrhage.
METHODS: We did a prospective observational cohort study in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage from the Prognosis of Intracerebral Haemorrhage (PITCH) cohort who were admitted to Lille University Hospital, Lille, France. We included patients aged 18 years and older with parenchymal haemorrhage on the first CT scan. Exclusion criteria were pure intraventricular haemorrhage; intracerebral haemorrhage resulting from intracranial vascular malformation, intracranial venous thrombosis, head trauma, or tumour; haemorrhagic transformation within an infarct; and referral from other hospitals. Median follow-up was 6 years. We studied risk factors (clinical and neuroradiological [MRI] biomarkers) of new-onset dementia as per a prespecified subgroup analysis, according to intracerebral haemorrhage location. Dementia diagnosis was based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association criteria for all-cause dementia. We did multivariable analyses using competing risk analyses, with death during follow-up as a competing event.
FINDINGS: From the 560 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage enrolled in the PITCH cohort between Nov 3, 2004 and March 29, 2009, we included 218 patients (median age 67·5 years) without pre-existing dementia who were alive at 6 months follow-up. 63 patients developed new-onset dementia leading to an incidence rate of 14·2\% (95\% CI 10·0-19·3) at 1 year after intracerebral haemorrhage, and incidence reached 28·3\% (22·4-34·5) at 4 years. The incidence of new-onset dementia was more than two times higher in patients with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (incidence at 1 year 23·4\%, 14·6-33·3) than for patients with non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (incidence at 1 year 9·2\%, 5·1-14·7). Disseminated superficial siderosis (subhazard ratio [SHR] 7·45, 95\% CI 4·27-12·99), cortical atrophy score (SHR per 1-point increase 2·61, 1·70-4·01), a higher number of cerebral microbleeds (SHR for {\textgreater}5 cerebral microbleeds 2·33, 1·38-3·94), and older age (SHR per 10-year increase 1·34, 1·00-1·79) were risk factors of new-onset dementia.
INTERPRETATION: There is a substantial risk of incident dementia in dementia-free survivors of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage; our results suggest that underlying cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a contributing factor to the occurrence of new-onset dementia. Future clinical trials including patients with intracerebral haemorrhage should assess cognitive endpoints.

	abstract = {Dementia and cognitive impairment are known as a major risk for falls and subsequent adverse events in the elderly. In addition to result in serious injury, including fractures, falls lead to functional decline due to fear of falling again and self limitation of activity in older adults. All types of dementia and all degrees of severity are involved. Rather than resulting from a single cause, falls are the result of a combination of intrinsic, situational, and environmental factors. The most common risk factors for falls in patients with cognitive impairment and dementia are gait and balance disturbances, behavioral disorders, visual problems, malnutrition, adverse effects of drugs, fear of falling, neurocardiovascular instability (particularly orthostatic hypotension), and environmental hazards. Based on data from studies in cognitively normal people who fall, a multifaceted intervention, including a physical exercise programme and modification of the risk factors may prevent falls in older people with cognitive impairment and dementia. Preliminary research suggests that physiotherapy may have a role for falls prevention in these patients. However, randomized studies need to be performed.},

The SPECT scans were visually rated by two nuclear medicine physicians (first blinded to the clinical data, then with the data). Comparisons between clinical diagnoses and/or SPECT imaging and neuropathology were performed. At the time of SPECT was performed, the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) sensitivity was 83\%, specificity was 76\%, and diagnostic accuracy was 79\%. The blinded SPECT sensitivity was 57\%, specificity 92\%, and diagnostic accuracy 75\%. The SPECT associated with clinical data sensitivity was 65\%, specificity 84\%, and accuracy 75\%. The clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal-lobar degeneration (FTLD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal degeneration syndrome (CBDs) sensitivity was 83\%, specificity 87\%, and accuracy 85\%.

Whenever the blinded SPECT interpretation agreed with the clinical diagnosis of AD and FTLD/PSP/CBDs, the condition was confirmed by neuropathological assessment in all cases. Compared with clinical diagnosis alone, SPECT imaging improved the specificity of the etiological diagnosis in degenerative dementia, although its sensitivity was not as good as that of clinical diagnosis. For AD and FTLD/PSP/CBDs, agreement between the clinical and SPECT-based diagnoses was always confirmed by neuropathological assessment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate cognitive inhibition in presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and its associated neuroanatomical correlates.
METHODS: Thirty-eight presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+, mean age 38.2±8.0 years) and 22 C9- controls from the PREV-DEMALS cohort were included in this study. They underwent a cognitive inhibition assessment with the Hayling Sentence Completion Test (HSCT; time to completion (part B-part A); error score in part B) as well as a 3D MRI.
RESULTS: C9+ individuals younger than 40 years had higher error scores (part B) but equivalent HSCT time to completion (part B-part A) compared to C9- individuals. C9+ individuals older than 40 years had both higher error scores and longer time to completion. HSCT time to completion significantly predicted the proximity to estimated clinical conversion from presymptomatic to symptomatic phase in C9+ individuals (based on the average age at onset of affected relatives in the family). Anatomically, we found that HSCT time to completion was associated with the integrity of the cerebellum.
CONCLUSION: The HSCT represents a good marker of cognitive inhibition impairments in C9+ and of proximity to clinical conversion. This study also highlights the key role of the cerebellum in cognitive inhibition.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13195-020-00753-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to heterogeneous clinical presentation, difficult differential diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and psychiatric disorders, and evolving clinical criteria, the epidemiology and natural history of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTD) remain elusive. In order to better characterize FTD patients, we relied on the database of a regional memory clinic network with standardized diagnostic procedures and chose AD patients as a comparator.
METHODS: Patients that were first referred to our network between January 2010 and December 2016 and whose last clinical diagnosis was degenerative or vascular dementia were included. Comparisons were conducted between FTD and AD as well as between the different FTD syndromes, divided into language variants (lvFTD), behavioral variant (bvFTD), and FTD with primarily motor symptoms (mFTD). Cognitive progression was estimated with the yearly decline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).
RESULTS: Among the patients that were referred to our network in the 6-year time span, 690 were ultimately diagnosed with FTD and 18,831 with AD. Patients with FTD syndromes represented 2.6\% of all-cause dementias. The age-standardized incidence was 2.90 per 100,000 person-year and incidence peaked between 75 and 79 years. Compared to AD, patients with FTD syndromes had a longer referral delay and delay to diagnosis. Patients with FTD syndromes had a higher MMSE score than AD at first referral while their progression was similar. mFTD patients had the shortest survival while survival in bvFTD, lvFTD, and AD did not significantly differ. FTD patients, especially those with the behavioral variant, received more antidepressants, anxiolytics, and antipsychotics than AD patients.
CONCLUSIONS: FTD syndromes differ with AD in characteristics at baseline, progression rate, and treatment. Despite a broad use of the new diagnostic criteria in an organized memory clinic network, FTD syndromes are longer to diagnose and account for a low proportion of dementia cases, suggesting persistent underdiagnosis. Congruent with recent publications, the late peak of incidence warns against considering FTD as being exclusively a young-onset dementia.},

We used the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) to systematically assess the pre-existing cognitive status. Of 403 patients (371 ischemia), 25 met criteria for pre-existing dementia, 142 for pre-existing cognitive decline-no-dementia, and 236 had no PCoI. Aβ1-42 was independently associated with PCoI (odds ratio 0.973; 95\% confidence interval: 0.950-0.996; p=0.024). Factors associated with plasma Aβ1- 40 were age, smoking and diabetes mellitus. After exclusion of hemorrhagic strokes, the results remained unchanged, but blood samples taken less than 12 hours after onset were associated with lower plasma Aβ1-40. Our results support a dissociated response of the 2 plasma Aβ peptides in stroke patients, plasma Aβ1-40 being involved in vascular aspects whereas Aβ1-42 might be involved in neurodegenerative processes.},

Menopausal chemo-naïve patients with resectable breast cancer were randomly assigned (1:1) at the end of the radiotherapy to receive tamoxifen or AI. Neuropsychological assessments, self-reported quality of life, and depression assessments were performed at baseline, before any hormonal treatment, and at 6 and 12 months. Mixed design analysis models of variance was used to compare the evolution of the scores between the groups during follow-up. A total of 74 evaluable patients were enrolled (Tamoxifen arm, n = 37; AI arm, n = 37; letrozole n = 18; anastrozole n = 16; exemestane n = 3). The median age at inclusion was 61 years (range, minimum 49-maximum 69). The patient and breast cancer characteristics were well balanced between arms. After 6 months, no significant differential effect of AI or tamoxifen was observed on the RAVLT. Moreover, considering the other cognitive measures and the quality of life questionnaires, there were also no differences between the groups during the 1-year follow-up. In this study, AI has not demonstrated worse adverse effects on cognitive functions than tamoxifen during a 1-year follow-up.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relevance of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders is clearly established. However, the question remains on how to use these data, which are often heterogeneous (not all biomarkers being pathologic). The objective of this study is to propose to physicians in memory clinics a biologic scale of probabilities that the patient with cognitive impairments has an Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologic process.
METHODS: For that purpose, we took advantage of the multicenter data of our Paris-North, Lille, and Montpellier (PLM) study, which has emerged through the initial sharing of information from these memory centers. Different models combining the CSF levels of amyloid-β 42, tau, and p-tau(181) were tested to generate categories of patients with very low ({\textless}10\%), low ({\textless}25\%), high ({\textgreater}75\%), and very high predictive values ({\textgreater}90\%) for positive AD. In total, 1,273 patients (646 AD and 627 non-AD) from six independent memory-clinic cohorts were included.
RESULTS: A prediction model based on logistic regressions achieved a very good stratification of the population but had the disadvantages of needing mathematical optimization and being difficult to use in daily clinical practice. Remarkably, a simple and intuitive model based on the number (from zero to three) of three pathologic CSF biomarkers resulted in a very efficient predictive scale for AD in patients seen in memory clinics. The scale's overall predictive value for AD for the different categories were as follows: class 0, 9.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 6.0\% to 13.2\%); class 1, 24.7\% (95\% CI, 18.0\% to 31.3\%); class 2, 77.2\% (95\% CI, 67.8\% to 86.5\%); and class 3, 94.2\% (95\% CI, 90.7\% to 97.7\%). In addition, with this scale, significantly more patients were correctly classified than with the logistic regression. Its superiority in model performance was validated by the computation of the net reclassification index (NRI). The model was also validated in an independent multicenter dataset of 408 patients (213 AD and 195 non-AD).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we defined a new scale that could be used to facilitate the interpretation and routine use of multivariate CSF data, as well as helping the stratification of patients in clinical research trials.},

These areas included the paralimbic regions for typical presentations of sporadic EOAD. For atypical presentations, the hypometabolic regions included Broca's and Wernicke's areas and the pulvinar in language forms, bilateral primary and higher processing visual regions (with right predominance) in visuospatial forms, and the bilateral prefrontal cortex in executive forms. Similar hypometabolism patterns were also observed in a correlation analysis of the 18F-FDG PET data versus domain-specific, neuropsychological test scores.

RESULTS: Two hundred five patients were enrolled with evaluable florbetaben PET scans; 64.4\% of scans were amyloid positive. PET results led to changed diagnosis and improved confidence in 66.8\% and 81.5\% of patients, respectively, and altered management in 80.0\% of cases.
DISCUSSION: High-level improvement of diagnostic certainty and management is provided by selective and hierarchical implementation of florbetaben PET into current standard practices for the most complex dementia cases.},

	abstract = {Brain vascular damage accumulate in aging and often manifest as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) on MRI. Despite increased interest in automated methods to segment WMHs, a gold standard has not been achieved and their longitudinal reproducibility has been poorly investigated. The aim of present work is to evaluate accuracy and reproducibility of two freely available segmentation algorithms. A harmonized MRI protocol was implemented in 3T-scanners across 13 European sites, each scanning five volunteers twice (test-retest) using 2D-FLAIR. Automated segmentation was performed using Lesion segmentation tool algorithms (LST): the Lesion growth algorithm (LGA) in SPM8 and 12 and the Lesion prediction algorithm (LPA). To assess reproducibility, we applied the LST longitudinal pipeline to the LGA and LPA outputs for both the test and retest scans. We evaluated volumetric and spatial accuracy comparing LGA and LPA with manual tracing, and for reproducibility the test versus retest. Median volume difference between automated WMH and manual segmentations (mL) was -0.22[IQR = 0.50] for LGA-SPM8, -0.12[0.57] for LGA-SPM12, -0.09[0.53] for LPA, while the spatial accuracy (Dice Coefficient) was 0.29[0.31], 0.33[0.26] and 0.41[0.23], respectively. The reproducibility analysis showed a median reproducibility error of 20\%[IQR = 41] for LGA-SPM8, 14\% [31] for LGA-SPM12 and 10\% [27] with the LPA cross-sectional pipeline. Applying the LST longitudinal pipeline, the reproducibility errors were considerably reduced (LGA: 0\%[IQR = 0], p {\textless} 0.001; LPA: 0\% [3], p {\textless} 0.001) compared to those derived using the cross-sectional algorithms. The DC using the longitudinal pipeline was excellent (median = 1) for LGA [IQR = 0] and LPA [0.02]. LST algorithms showed moderate accuracy and good reproducibility.

We hypothesised that rare copy number variants (CNVs) could be involved in ADEOAD families without mutations in known genes, as well as in rare sporadic young-onset AD cases. Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridisation, we assessed the presence of rare CNVs in 21 unrelated ADEOAD cases, having no alteration on known genes, and 12 sporadic AD cases, with an age of onset younger than 55 years. The analysis revealed the presence of 7 singleton CNVs (4 in ADEOAD and 3 in sporadic cases) absent in 1078 controls and 912 late-onset AD cases. Strikingly, 4 out of 7 rearrangements target genes (KLK6, SLC30A3, MEOX2, and FPR2) encoding proteins that are tightly related to amyloid-β peptide metabolism or signalling. Although these variants are individually rare and restricted to particular subgroups of patients, these findings support the causal role, in human pathology, of a set of genes coding for molecules suspected for a long time to modify Aβ metabolism or signalling, and for which animal or cellular models have already been developed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have an increased risk of dementia. The identification of predictors of conversion to dementia is therefore important. The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that subcortical hyperintensities (SH) are associated with an increased rate of conversion to dementia in MCI patients.
METHODS: This was an observational study on consecutive MCI patients attending a memory clinic. We assessed SH on a baseline MRI scan, using a semiquantitative rating scale. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to test the association of SH with conversion to dementia.
RESULTS: We included 170 MCI patients. The median duration of follow-up was 3.8 years. During this period, 67 patients (39.4\%, 95\% CI: 32.1 to 46.8\%) developed dementia: Alzheimer disease (AD) in 29 patients, dementia with Lewy bodies in 19, mixed dementia in 8, vascular dementia in 7, fronto-temporal dementia in 2, and primary progressive aphasia in 2. SH were not associated with the risk to develop dementia as a whole, including AD. However, the risk to develop vascular or mixed dementia increased significantly with increasing amounts of SH at baseline (HR=1.14 [95\% CI: 1.06 to 1.24]), especially periventricular hyperintensities (HR=2.71 [95\% CI: 1.60 to 4.58]), independently of medial temporal lobe atrophy, age, gender, vascular risk factors, education, and cognitive functions at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of vascular or mixed dementia, but not of other types of dementia, was significantly increased in MCI patients with a large amount of subcortical hyperintensities at baseline.},

Here, we sought to determine whether or not continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for sleep apnoea syndrome (SAS) slows the rate of cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients.
METHODS: Between January 2003 and June 2011, we included consecutive, mild-to-moderate AD patients (a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at inclusion ≥15) with severe SAS as determined by video-polysomnography (an apnoea-hypopnoea index ≥30). In this single-blind, proof-of-concept trial, we analysed the mean decline in the annual MMSE score (the main outcome measure) according to whether or not the patients had received CPAP therapy. The decline was computed for each patient and for the first 3 years of follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 23 included patients, 14 underwent CPAP treatment. The CPAP and non-CPAP groups did not differ significantly in terms of their demographic characteristics or MMSE score at baseline. The median annual MMSE decline was significantly slower in the CPAP group (-0.7 (-1.7; +0.8)) than in the non-CPAP group (-2.2 (-3.3; -1.9); p=0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, CPAP treatment of severe SAS in mild-to-moderate AD patients was associated with significantly slower cognitive decline over a three-year follow-up period. Our results emphasise the importance of detecting and treating SAS in this population.},

To determine the number and characteristics of YOD patients cared for in UCC in France during the year 2013. A specific questionnaire was sent to the 84 French UCC. The questionnaire was completed by 55 UCC (65\%), whose 33 received 179 YOD patients. The diagnosis was Alzheimer's disease in 50\% of the cases and frontotemporal dementia in 30\%. The main reasons for the hospitalization in UCC were the severity of behavioral symptoms in 86\% of cases, the need to alleviate the caregiver burden in 31\% and the waiting for a place in a nursing home in 23\%. Mean duration of hospitalization was 40.4 ± 20.5 days. At the end of hospitalization 51\% of the patients returned to their original living accomodation and 39\% entered into a nursing home. The main reason of YOD patients hospitalization reject was the care team's fear in the UCC without experience. The severity of the behavioral troubles was the major issue while the necessary ethical reflection raised by the YOD patients management was a positive aspect. The teams rated how ready do they feel about taking care of YOD patients on a scale from 0 to 100, the median was 35. The welcoming of YOD patients in UCC is necessary, however the severity of the behavioral troubles and the care teams fear prompt to set up specific education and to increase of the number of staff for YOD patients management.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the influence of prestroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) on outcomes in stroke patients treated with IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA).
METHODS: OPHELIE-COG was a prospective observational multicenter study conducted in French and Japanese patients treated with IV rtPA for cerebral ischemia. The preexisting cognitive status was evaluated by the short version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly. PSCI was defined as a mean score {\textgreater}3. The primary endpoint was a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0-1) after 3 months. Secondary endpoints were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), mRS scores 0-2, and mortality at 3 months. We performed a pooled analysis with Biostroke and Strokdem.
RESULTS: Of 205 patients, 62 (30.2\%) met criteria for PSCI. They were 11 years older (p {\textless} 0.001). Although they had more sICH and were less frequently independent after 3 months, they did not differ for any endpoint after adjustment for age, baseline NIH Stroke Scale score, and onset-to-needle time: sICH (odds ratio [OR] 2.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-11.86), mRS 0-1 (OR 0.82; 95\% CI 0.41-1.65), mRS 0-2 (OR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.28-1.37), death (OR 0.40; 95\% CI 0.08-2.03). The pooled analysis found no association of PSCI with any endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic stroke patients with PSCI should receive rtPA if they are eligible. This conclusion cannot be extended to severe cognitive impairment or severe strokes.
CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that in patients with PSCI presenting with acute ischemic stroke, IV rtPA improves outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine and compare longitudinal changes of cortical glucose metabolism in amnestic and non-amnestic sporadic forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease and assess potential associations with neuropsychological performance over a 3-year period time.
METHODS: Eighty-two participants meeting criteria for early-onset ({\textless} 65 years) sporadic form of probable Alzheimer's disease and presenting with a variety of clinical phenotypes (47 amnestic and 35 non-amnestic forms) were included at baseline and followed up for 1.44 ± 1.23 years. All of the participants underwent a work-up at baseline and every year during the follow-up period, which includes clinical examination, neuropsychological testing, genotyping, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker assays, and structural MRI and 18F-FDG PET. Vertex-wise partial volume-corrected glucose metabolic maps across the entire cortical surface were generated and longitudinally assessed together with the neuropsychological scores using linear mixed-effects modeling as a function of amnestic and non-amnestic sporadic forms of early-onset Alzheimer's disease.
RESULTS: Similar evolution patterns of glucose metabolic decline between amnestic and non-amnestic forms were observed in widespread neocortical cortices. However, only non-amnestic forms appeared to have a greater reduction of glucose metabolism in lateral orbitofrontal and bilateral medial temporal cortices associated with more severe declines of neuropsychological performance compared with amnestic forms. Furthermore, results suggest that glucose metabolic decline in amnestic forms would progress along an anterior-to-posterior axis, whereas glucose metabolic decline in non-amnestic forms would progress along a posterior-to-anterior axis.
CONCLUSIONS: We found differences in spatial distribution and temporal trajectory of glucose metabolic decline between amnestic and non-amnestic early-onset Alzheimer's disease groups, suggesting that one might want to consider treating the two forms of the disease as two separate entities.},

We carried out a texture analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify predictive markers of CI occurrence based on a combination of preclinical and clinical data. Seventy-two-hour post-stroke T1W MR images of 160 consecutive patients were examined, including 75 patients with confirmed CI at the 6-month post-stroke neuropsychological examination. Texture features were measured in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex and compared between patients with CI and those without. A correlation study determined their association with MoCA and MMSE clinical scores. Significant features were then combined with the classical prognostic factors, age and gender, to build a machine learning algorithm as a predictive model for CI occurrence. A middle cerebral artery transient occlusion model was used. Texture features were compared in the hippocampus of sham and lesioned rats and were correlated with histologically assessed neural loss. In clinical studies, two texture features, kurtosis and inverse difference moment, differed significantly between patients with and without CI and were significantly correlated with MoCA and MMSE scores. The prediction model had an accuracy of 88 ± 3\%. The preclinical model revealed a significant correlation between texture features and neural density in the hippocampus contralateral to the ischemic area. These preliminary results suggest that texture features of MR images are representative of neural alteration and could be a part of a screening strategy for the early prediction of post-stroke CI.},

Limited data is currently available to assess the performance of physiological noise correction techniques, in particular when evaluating longitudinal changes in the default mode network (DMN) of healthy elderly participants. In this 3T harmonized multisite fMRI study, we investigated how different retrospective physiological noise correction (rPNC) methods influence the within-site test-retest reliability and the across-site reproducibility consistency of DMN-derived measurements across 13 MRI sites. Elderly participants were scanned twice at least a week apart (five participants per site). The rPNC methods were: none (NPC), Tissue-based regression, PESTICA and FSL-FIX. The DMN at the single subject level was robustly identified using ICA methods in all rPNC conditions. The methods significantly affected the mean z-scores and, albeit less markedly, the cluster-size in the DMN; in particular, FSL-FIX tended to increase the DMN z-scores compared to others. Within-site test-retest reliability was consistent across sites, with no differences across rPNC methods. The absolute percent errors were in the range of 5-11\% for DMN z-scores and cluster-size reliability. DMN pattern overlap was in the range 60-65\%. In particular, no rPNC method showed a significant reliability improvement relative to NPC. However, FSL-FIX and Tissue-based physiological correction methods showed both similar and significant improvements of reproducibility consistency across the consortium (ICC = 0.67) for the DMN z-scores relative to NPC. Overall these findings support the use of rPNC methods like tissue-based or FSL-FIX to characterize multisite longitudinal changes of intrinsic functional connectivity.

METHODS: Longitudinal studies with ≥75 participants who had suffered or were at risk of stroke or TIA and which evaluated cognitive function were invited to join STROKOG. The consortium will facilitate projects investigating rates and patterns of cognitive decline, risk factors for VCD, and biomarkers of vascular dementia.
RESULTS: Currently, STROKOG includes 25 (21 published) studies, with 12,092 participants from five continents. The duration of follow-up ranges from 3 months to 21 years.
DISCUSSION: Although data harmonization will be a key challenge, STROKOG is in a unique position to reuse and combine international cohort data and fully explore patient level characteristics and outcomes. STROKOG could potentially transform our understanding of VCD and have a worldwide impact on promoting better vascular cognitive outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One can reasonably suppose that cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers can identify distinct subgroups of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In order to better understand differences in CSF biomarker patterns, we used FDG PET to assess cerebral metabolism in CSF-based subgroups of AD patients.
METHODS: Eighty-five patients fulfilling the criteria for probable early-onset AD (EOAD) underwent lumbar puncture, brain 18F-FDG PET and MRI. A cluster analysis was performed, with the CSF biomarkers for AD as variables. Vertex-wise, partial-volume-corrected metabolic maps were computed for the patients and compared between the clusters of patients. Linear correlations between each CSF biomarker and the metabolic maps were assessed.
RESULTS: Three clusters emerged. The "Aβ42" cluster contained 32 patients with low levels of Aβ42, while tau and p-tau remained within the normal range. The "Aβ42 + tau" cluster contained 41 patients with low levels of Aβ42 and high levels of tau and p-tau. Lastly, the "tau" cluster contained 12 patients with very high levels of tau and p-tau and low-normal levels of Aβ42. There were no inter-cluster differences in age, sex ratio, educational level, APOE genotype, disease duration or disease severity. The "Aβ42 + tau" and "tau" clusters displayed more marked frontal hypometabolism than the "Aβ42" cluster did, and frontal metabolism was significantly negatively correlated with the CSF tau level. The "Aβ42" and "Aβ42 + tau" clusters displayed more marked hypometabolism in the left occipitotemporal region than the "tau" cluster did, and metabolism in this region was significantly and positively correlated with the CSF Aβ42 level.
CONCLUSION: The CSF biomarkers can be used to identify metabolically distinct subgroups of patients with EOAD. Future research should seek to establish whether these biochemical differences have clinical consequences.},

The rationale for Tau as a biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases is that it is a major component of abnormal intraneuronal aggregates observed in numerous tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. The molecular diversity of Tau is very useful when analyzing it in the brain or in the peripheral fluids. Immunohistochemical and biochemical characterization of Tau aggregates in the brain allows the postmortem classification and differential diagnosis of tauopathies. As peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in the cerebrospinal fluid, Tau proteins are now validated for diagnosis and predictive purposes. For the future, the detailed characterization of Tau in the brain and in peripheral fluids will lead to novel promising biomarkers for differential diagnosis of dementia and monitoring of therapeutics.},

We conducted a whole exome analysis among 484 French EOAD patients and 498 ethnically matched controls. After collapsing rare variants (minor allele frequency ≤1\%), we detected an enrichment of disruptive and predicted damaging missense SORL1 variants in cases (odds radio (OR)=5.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=(2.02-14.99), P=7.49.10(-5)).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess seizure frequency in a large French cohort of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer disease (ADEOAD) and to determine possible correlations with causative mutations.
METHODS: A national multicentric study was performed in patients with ADEOAD harboring a pathogenic mutation within PSEN1, PSEN2, APP, or a duplication of APP, and a minimal follow-up of 5 years. Clinical, EEG, and imaging data were systematically recorded.
RESULTS: We included 132 patients from 77 families: 94 PSEN1 mutation carriers (MCs), 16 APP duplication carriers, 15 APP MCs, and 7 PSEN2 MCs. Seizure frequency was 47.7\% after a mean follow-up of 8.4 years (range 5-25). After 5-year follow-up and using a Cox model analysis, the percentages of patients with seizures were respectively 19.1\% (10.8\%-26.7\%) for PSEN1, 28.6\% (0\%-55.3\%) for PSEN2, 31.2\% (4.3\%-50.6\%) for APP duplications, and no patient for APP mutation. APP duplication carriers showed a significantly increased seizure risk compared to both APP MCs (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.55 [95\% confidence interval 1.87-16.44]) and PSEN1 MCs (HR = 4.46 [2.11-9.44]). Among all PSEN1 mutations, those within the domains of protein hydrophilic I, transmembrane II (TM-II), TM-III, TM-IV, and TM-VII were associated with a significant increase in seizure frequency compared to other domains (HR = 4.53 [1.93-10.65], p = 0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: Seizures are a common feature of ADEOAD. In this population, risk was significantly higher in the APP duplication group than in all other groups. Within PSEN1, 5 specific domains were associated with a higher seizure risk indicating specific correlations between causative mutation and seizures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few patients with a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile fulfill the clinical criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis of misdiagnoses for these patients.
METHOD: Patients from the e-PLM centers fulfilling the core clinical criteria for probable AD dementia or mild cognitive impairment due to AD (AD-MCI), with normal CSF Aβ1-42, T-tau and P-tau biomarkers and clinical follow-up, were included. Clinical and imaging data were reviewed by an independent board, from baseline (visit with clinical evaluation and CSF analysis) to the end of the follow-up, for a final diagnosis.
RESULTS: In the e-PLM cohort of 1098 AD patients with CSF analysis, 37 (3.3\%) patients (20 with AD dementia core clinical criteria and 17 with AD-MCI core clinical criteria) had normal CSF biomarker profile and a clinical follow-up. All patients presented with episodic memory impairment and 27 (73\%) had medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI-scan. After a median follow-up of 36 months (range 7-74), the final diagnosis was AD MCI or dementia for 9 (24\%) patients, and unlikely due to AD for 28 (76\%) patients. A misdiagnosis was corrected in 18 (49\%) patients (mood disorders, non-AD degenerative dementia, vascular cognitive impairment, alcohol cognitive disorders, temporal epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis), and 10 (27\%) patients had cognitive disorders of undetermined etiology.
CONCLUSION: AD diagnosis (MCI or dementia) with normal CSF biomarkers is a rare condition. A clinical follow- up is particularly recommended to consider an alternative diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Based on the recent literature and collective experience, an international consortium developed revised guidelines for the diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. The validation process retrospectively reviewed clinical records and compared the sensitivity of proposed and earlier criteria in a multi-site sample of patients with pathologically verified frontotemporal lobar degeneration. According to the revised criteria, 'possible' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia requires three of six clinically discriminating features (disinhibition, apathy/inertia, loss of sympathy/empathy, perseverative/compulsive behaviours, hyperorality and dysexecutive neuropsychological profile). 'Probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia adds functional disability and characteristic neuroimaging, while behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia 'with definite frontotemporal lobar degeneration' requires histopathological confirmation or a pathogenic mutation. Sixteen brain banks contributed cases meeting histopathological criteria for frontotemporal lobar degeneration and a clinical diagnosis of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia at presentation. Cases with predominant primary progressive aphasia or extra-pyramidal syndromes were excluded. In these autopsy-confirmed cases, an experienced neurologist or psychiatrist ascertained clinical features necessary for making a diagnosis according to previous and proposed criteria at presentation. Of 137 cases where features were available for both proposed and previously established criteria, 118 (86\%) met 'possible' criteria, and 104 (76\%) met criteria for 'probable' behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. In contrast, 72 cases (53\%) met previously established criteria for the syndrome (P {\textless} 0.001 for comparison with 'possible' and 'probable' criteria). Patients who failed to meet revised criteria were significantly older and most had atypical presentations with marked memory impairment. In conclusion, the revised criteria for behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia improve diagnostic accuracy compared with previously established criteria in a sample with known frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Greater sensitivity of the proposed criteria may reflect the optimized diagnostic features, less restrictive exclusion features and a flexible structure that accommodates different initial clinical presentations. Future studies will be needed to establish the reliability and specificity of these revised diagnostic guidelines.},

	abstract = {AIM: To assess reasons that prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from being included in clinical trials.
METHODS: In 2009, we reviewed the Lille Memory Clinic's case database to identify patients suitable for inclusion in four AD clinical trials. An initial selection was made on the basis of four criteria: (i) a diagnosis of AD (with or without white matter lesions [WML]), (ii) age, (iii) mini mental state examination (MMSE) score and (iv) symptomatic treatment of AD (cholinesterase inhibitors/memantine). Next, data on patients fulfilling these criteria were reviewed against all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for four clinical trials performed in 2009 at the Memory Clinic. Reasons for non-inclusion were analyzed.
RESULTS: Two hundred and five patients were selected according to the four initial criteria. Reasons for subsequently not including some of patients in clinical trials were abnormalities on MRI (56.9\%, 88.9\% of which were WML), unauthorized medication (37.3\%), the lack of a study partner/informant (37.1\%), the presence of a non-authorized disease (24.4\%), contraindication to MRI (9\%), a change in diagnosis over time (3.9\%), visual/auditory impairments (2.9\%), alcohol abuse (2\%) and an insufficient educational level (1\%).
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of AD patients presented with vascular abnormalities on MRI. This was not unexpected, since the patients were selected from the database and, as shown in epidemiologic studies, cerebrovascular diseases are frequently associated with AD. The presence of a study partner is essential for enabling a patient to participate in clinical trials because of the need to record reliably primary and secondary outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To address the variability in prevalence estimates and inconsistencies in potential risk factors for poststroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) using a standardized approach and individual participant data (IPD) from international cohorts in the Stroke and Cognition Consortium (STROKOG) consortium.
METHODS: We harmonized data from 13 studies based in 8 countries. Neuropsychological test scores 2 to 6 months after stroke or TIA and appropriate normative data were used to calculate standardized cognitive domain scores. Domain-specific impairment was based on percentile cutoffs from normative groups, and associations between domain scores and risk factors were examined with 1-stage IPD meta-analysis.
RESULTS: In a combined sample of 3,146 participants admitted to hospital for stroke (97\%) or TIA (3\%), 44\% were impaired in global cognition and 30\% to 35\% were impaired in individual domains 2 to 6 months after the index event. Diabetes mellitus and a history of stroke were strongly associated with poorer cognitive function after covariate adjustments; hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation had weaker domain-specific associations. While there were no significant differences in domain impairment among ethnoracial groups, some interethnic differences were found in the effects of risk factors on cognition.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the high prevalence of PSCI in diverse populations, highlights common risk factors, in particular diabetes mellitus, and points to ethnoracial differences that warrant attention in the development of prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {Risk of dementia increases after stroke, and poststroke dementia (PSD) is an important cause of disability in the elderly. The prevalence rates of PSD vary from 12.2\% to 31.8\% within 3 months to 1 year after stroke, depending on patient populations and the diagnostic criteria used in the numerous studies. Incidence rates of PSD increase with time after the stroke. Although vascular lesions and white matter changes can explain the cognitive disorders seen in stroke patients, an underlying neurodegenerative disorder may contribute to the development of PSD. Cognitive decline may pre-date the stroke and follow a progressive course after the stroke. The vascular and degenerative processes involved share common environmental and genetic risk factors. This review explains the mechanisms of dementia in stroke patients and identifies predictive factors for PSD. The following points are successively considered: (i) demographic characteristics of the patients, including age and level of education; (ii) prestroke cognitive decline; (iii) vascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus and prior strokes; (iv) stroke characteristics, including severity and location of the vascular lesion; (v) co-morbid disorders; and (vi) abnormalities on brain imaging, including location, size and number of vascular lesions, white matter changes and cerebral atrophy. Older age, prestroke cognitive decline, stroke recurrence, hypoxic-ischaemic disorders, left-side infarcts, strategic infarcts and white matter lesions appear to be the main predictive factors of PSD. Prevention of stroke should reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with PSD. In addition, management of PSD with secondary prevention treatments could reduce occurrence of further strokes. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial not only in Alzheimer's disease associated with cerebrovascular lesions, but also for the treatment of cholinergic dysfunction arising from pure vascular dementia. Better knowledge of the risk factors for PSD, including environmental and genetic factors, should increase the effectiveness of preventive strategies in patients with this condition.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify potential biomarkers of preclinical and clinical progression in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 gene (C9orf72)-associated disease by assessing the expression levels of plasma microRNAs (miRNAs) in C9orf72 patients and presymptomatic carriers.
METHODS: The PREV-DEMALS study is a prospective study including 22 C9orf72 patients, 45 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers and 43 controls. We assessed the expression levels of 2576 miRNAs, among which 589 were above noise level, in plasma samples of all participants using RNA sequencing. The expression levels of the differentially expressed miRNAs between patients, presymptomatic carriers and controls were further used to build logistic regression classifiers.
RESULTS: Four miRNAs were differentially expressed between patients and controls: miR-34a-5p and miR-345-5p were overexpressed, while miR-200c-3p and miR-10a-3p were underexpressed in patients. MiR-34a-5p was also overexpressed in presymptomatic carriers compared with healthy controls, suggesting that miR-34a-5p expression is deregulated in cases with C9orf72 mutation. Moreover, miR-345-5p was also overexpressed in patients compared with presymptomatic carriers, which supports the correlation of miR-345-5p expression with the progression of C9orf72-associated disease. Together, miR-200c-3p and miR-10a-3p underexpression might be associated with full-blown disease. Four presymptomatic subjects in transitional/prodromal stage, close to the disease conversion, exhibited a stronger similarity with the expression levels of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a signature of four miRNAs differentially expressed in plasma between clinical conditions that have potential to represent progression biomarkers for C9orf72-associated frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study suggests that dysregulation of miRNAs is dynamically altered throughout neurodegenerative diseases progression, and can be detectable even long before clinical onset.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the added value of neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) compared with conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and anatomical MRI to detect changes in presymptomatic carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) mutation.
METHODS: The PREV-DEMALS (Predict to Prevent Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) study is a prospective, multicentre, observational study of first-degree relatives of individuals carrying the C9orf72 mutation. Sixty-seven participants (38 presymptomatic C9orf72 mutation carriers (C9+) and 29 non-carriers (C9-)) were included in the present cross-sectional study. Each participant underwent one single-shell, multishell diffusion MRI and three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI. Volumetric measures, DTI and NODDI metrics were calculated within regions of interest. Differences in white matter integrity, grey matter volume and free water fraction between C9+ and C9- individuals were assessed using linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Compared with C9-, C9+ demonstrated white matter abnormalities in 10 tracts with neurite density index and only 5 tracts with DTI metrics. Effect size was significantly higher for the neurite density index than for DTI metrics in two tracts. No tract had a significantly higher effect size for DTI than for NODDI. For grey matter cortical analysis, free water fraction was increased in 13 regions in C9+, whereas 11 regions displayed volumetric atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: NODDI provides higher sensitivity and greater tissue specificity compared with conventional DTI for identifying white matter abnormalities in the presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers. Our results encourage the use of neurite density as a biomarker of the preclinical phase.

However, little is known about the test-retest reproducibility of such measures, particularly in the context of multisite studies. Here, we report the reproducibility of automated Freesurfer hippocampal subfields segmentations in 65 healthy elderly enrolled in a consortium of 13 3T MRI sites (five subjects per site). Participants were scanned in two sessions (test and retest) at least one week apart. Each session included two anatomical 3D T1 MRI acquisitions harmonized in the consortium. We evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of subfields segmentation (i) to assess the effects of averaging two within-session T1 images and (ii) to compare subfields with whole hippocampus volume and spatial reliability. We found that within-session averaging of two T1 images significantly improved the reproducibility of all hippocampal subfields but not that of the whole hippocampus. Volumetric and spatial reproducibility across MRI sites were very good for the whole hippocampus, CA2-3, CA4-dentate gyrus (DG), subiculum (reproducibility error∼2\% and DICE {\textgreater} 0.90), good for CA1 and presubiculum (reproducibility error ∼ 5\% and DICE ∼ 0.90), and poorer for fimbria and hippocampal fissure (reproducibility error ∼ 15\% and DICE {\textless} 0.80). Spearman's correlations confirmed that test-retest reproducibility improved with volume size. Despite considerable differences of MRI scanner configurations, we found consistent hippocampal subfields volumes estimation. CA2-3, CA4-DG, and sub-CA1 (subiculum, presubiculum, and CA1 pooled together) gave test-retest reproducibility similar to the whole hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the larger hippocampal subfields volume may be reliable longitudinal markers in multisite studies.},

	abstract = {Theory of mind reasoning-the ability to understand someone else's mental states, such as beliefs, intentions and desires-is crucial in social interaction. It has been suggested that a theory of mind deficit may account for some of the abnormalities in interpersonal behaviour that characterize patients affected by behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. However, there are conflicting reports as to whether understanding someone else's mind is a key difference between behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Literature data on the relationship between theory of mind abilities and executive functions are also contradictory. These disparities may be due to underestimation of the fractionation within theory of mind components. A recent theoretical framework suggests that taking someone else's mental perspective requires two distinct processes: inferring someone else's belief and inhibiting one's own belief, with involvement of the temporoparietal and right frontal cortices, respectively. Therefore, we performed a neuropsychological and neuroimaging study to investigate the hypothesis whereby distinct cognitive deficits could impair theory of mind reasoning in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. We used a three-option false belief task to assess theory of mind components in 11 patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 12 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 20 healthy elderly control subjects. The patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and those with Alzheimer's disease were matched for age, gender, education and global cognitive impairment. [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography imaging was used to investigate neural correlates of theory of mind reasoning deficits. Performance in the three-option false belief task revealed differential impairments in the components of theory of mind reasoning; patients with Alzheimer's disease had a predominant deficit in inferring someone else's belief, whereas patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia were selectively impaired in inhibiting their own mental perspective. Moreover, inhibiting one's own perspective was strongly correlated with inhibition in a Stroop task but not with other subprocesses of executive functions. This finding suggests that self-perspective inhibition may depend on cognitive processes that are not specific to the social domain. Last, the severity of the deficit in inferring someone else's beliefs correlated significantly over all subjects with hypometabolism in the left temporoparietal junction, whereas the severity of the deficit in self-perspective inhibition correlated significantly with hypometabolism in the right lateral prefrontal cortex. In conclusion, our findings provided clinical and imaging evidence to support differential deficits in two components of theory of mind reasoning (subserved by distinct brain regions) in patients with Alzheimer's disease and patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.},

CASE PRESENTATION: Two male patients (aged 41 and 70) with multiple myeloma developed severe, rapidly progressing cognitive impairment (mostly involving episodic memory) and loss of independence in activities of daily living during lenalidomide-based treatment. On withdrawal of the drug, one patient recovered normal cognitive function and independence in activities of daily living, whereas mild cognitive impairment persisted in the other patient. The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale score was 6 out of 13 for the first patient and 5 out of 13 for the second, suggesting a probable causal relationship between the adverse event and lenalidomide administration.
CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide may induce particular cognitive disorders (notably episodic memory impairments) in some patients. The drug's putative neurotoxicity is probably promoted by specific risk factors (such as previous chemotherapy, prior mild cognitive impairment, age and the presence of cerebrovascular lesions).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determinants of early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) are not well known. In late-onset AD, vascular risk factors (VRFs) are associated with earlier clinical manifestation.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the putative association between VRFs and EOAD.
METHODS: We studied participants with dementia meeting criteria for EOAD (recruited into the French CoMAJ prospective cohort study from 1 June 2009 to 28 February 2014) and age-, gender-matched controls (ratio 1:3, drawn randomly from the French MONA-LISA population-based survey between 2005 and 2007). Demographic data, VRFs, comorbidities, treatments, and APOE genotypes were compared in multivariable logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: We studied 102 participants with dementia (mean±standard deviation age: 59.5±3.8; women: 59.8\%) and 306 controls. Compared with controls, EOAD participants had spent less time in formal education (9.9±2.9 versus 11.7±3.8 y; p {\textless} 0.0001), were less likely to be regular alcohol consumers (p {\textless} 0.0001), had a lower body mass index (-2 kg/m2; p {\textless} 0.0004), and a lower mean systolic blood pressure (-6.2 mmHg; p = 0.0036). The prevalence of APOE ɛ4 allele was higher in participants with dementia than in controls (50\% versus 29.4\%; p = 0.0002), as was the prevalence of depression (48\% versus 32\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Similar results were observed in multivariable analysis. Compared with EOAD participants lacking VRFs, EOAD participants with at least one VRF had a higher prevalence of depression (29.6\% versus 53.3\%, respectively; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of VRFs is not elevated in EOAD patients (in contrast to older AD patients). Extensive genetic testing should be considered more frequently in the context of EOAD.},

We implemented a harmonized resting-state fMRI protocol on 13 clinical scanners at 3.0T using vendor-provided sequences. Each site scanned a group of 5 healthy elderly participants twice, at least a week apart. We evaluated inter-site differences and test-retest reproducibility of both temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and functional connectivity measurements derived from: i) seed-based analysis (SBA) with seed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ii) group independent component analysis (ICA) separately for each site (site ICA), and iii) consortium ICA, with group ICA across the whole consortium. Despite protocol harmonization, significant and quantitatively important inter-site differences remained in the tSNR of resting-state fMRI data; these were plausibly driven by hardware and pulse sequence differences across scanners which could not be harmonized. Nevertheless, the tSNR test-retest reproducibility in the consortium was high (ICC=0.81). The DMN was consistently extracted across all sites and analysis methods. While significant inter-site differences in connectivity scores were found, there were no differences in the associated test-retest error. Overall, ICA measurements were more reliable than PCC-SBA, with site ICA showing higher reproducibility than consortium ICA. Across the DMN nodes, the PCC yielded the most reliable measurements (≈4\% test-retest error, ICC=0.85), the medial frontal cortex the least reliable (≈12\%, ICC=0.82) and the lateral parietal cortices were in between (site ICA). Altogether these findings support usage of harmonized multisite studies of resting-state functional connectivity to characterize longitudinal effects in studies that assess disease progression and treatment response.},

These mutations were not retrieved in 1500 controls of same ethnic origin. In a replication sample, including 15 ADEOAD cases, 2 unknown non-synonymous mutations (1 missense, 1 nonsense) were retrieved, thus yielding to a total of 7/29 unknown mutations in the combined sample. Using in silico predictions, we conclude that these seven private mutations are likely to have a pathogenic effect. SORL1 encodes the Sortilin-related receptor LR11/SorLA, a protein involved in the control of amyloid beta peptide production.

	abstract = {Free water elimination (FWE) in brain diffusion MRI has been shown to improve tissue specificity in human white matter characterization both in health and in disease. Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test-retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55-80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1\% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects.

These factors contribute to reduce self-awareness and recognition of identify of others and by others. Autobiographical amnesia, loss of insight and executive dysfunctions are the major reasons of vulnerable "self" in FTD. Mind representation deficits, decrease of perception of emotions and semantic amnesia contribute to reduced recognition of the relative's identity. Alterations of body expressions, social disinhibition, changes in social and religious values decrease the recognition of patient's identity by the relatives. Different psychological components of identity are modified by the FTD such as feeling of unity, of consistency, of temporality and of affiliation. The fact that brain lesions of FTD are focalized can contribute to understand the biological knowledge of "identity". To know the neurological substrate of alterations of identity, this can help to improve the empathy of the suffering caregivers for the patient.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The assessment of total tau, phosphorylated tau (pTau-181) and amyloid beta (Aβ 1-42) concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of subjects has been validated for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although these measurements have shown some variability, little is known about their intersite variability in clinical settings.
METHODS: A total of 880 subjects (AD, n = 515; non-AD, n = 365) from three French memory centers were included. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were performed to computerized area under curves (AUCs) and optimal thresholds for each biomarker in the three centers. A test-retest study was performed in a group of 32 CSF samples by repeated blind analysis of the three biomarkers using the same immunoassay batches in the three centers.
RESULTS: In the three centers, tau (AUC, 0.82-0.88) and pTau-181 (AUC, 0.83-0.89) outperformed Aβ 1-42 (AUC, 0.70 -0.73) to discriminate subjects with AD from those without AD. An intersite variation of mean levels and cutoffs was observed for the three biomarkers. This variation was higher for Aβ 1-42 (range of cutoff, 368-582 pg/mL) than for tau (range of cutoff, 289-353 pg/mL). In a test-retest study, the mean interlaboratory coefficients of variation were 12.2\% for Aβ 1-42, 11.3\% for tau, and 11.5\% for pTau-181.
CONCLUSION: Intercenter variability of CSF biomarkers has been confirmed in a multisite cohort of subjects and can be improved in clinical settings. Efforts on harmonization of procedures should be encouraged to optimize the accuracy of CSF biomarkers in AD.},

This study is part of STROKDEM, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study, whose main aim is to determine predictors of poststroke dementia. Patients were included within 72 hours after an ischemic stroke and followed up with standardized evaluations. Medication use 7 days and 6 months after stroke was rated, and polypharmacy was defined as the number of categories of treatments received by a patient. PSF was evaluated using the Chalder Fatigue Scale. Medical history, vascular risk factors, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances were evaluated. One hundred and fifty-three patients were included: 52.9\% presented PSF. PSF at 6 months was not predicted by medication use at discharge nor associated with medication use at month 6. We found severity of PSF to be increased in patients with polypharmacy. Our results suggest that PSF is not a side effect of drugs use, which more reflects presence of disturbances frequently observed after stroke such as depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbances.

In order to evaluate the clinical interest and use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, a data-sharing project, the PLM (Paris-North, Lille and Montpellier) study has emerged through collaboration between these memory centers, already involved in this field. The revised Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis criteria include CSF biomarkers, but little is known about their use in routine clinical practice. To evaluate their interest and diagnostic accuracy in routine AD diagnosis, a cohort of 677 patients from Montpellier was first analyzed. The results were then validated through the analysis of a second cohort of 638 patients from Lille and Paris-Nord. Diagnoses of AD and other dementias were established by multidisciplinary expert teams, based on neuropsychological exams and structural brain imaging, blinded from CSF results. CSF amyloid-β, tau, and p-tau concentrations were measured for all patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to define cut-offs and evaluate the ability of each biomarker to discriminate AD from other diagnoses. We showed that p-tau outperformed other biomarkers for discriminating AD from non-AD patients and presents a clear clinical interest. The other biomarkers also showed relevant variations especially when the differential AD diagnoses were taken into account. Altogether we could demonstrate in both mono-centric and multi-centric cohorts from memory clinics the capacity of CSF biomarkers to discriminate AD from non-AD patients in clinical routine with a high sensitivity and specificity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Converging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with FTD-related disorders-namely, FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-and 1 or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis. We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA, up to 160-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and UC, up to 180-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and T1D, and up to 175-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and CeD. In contrast, for CBD and PSP, only 1 of the 6 immune-mediated diseases produced genetic enrichment comparable to that seen for FTD, with up to 150-fold genetic enrichment between CBD and CeD and up to 180-fold enrichment between PSP and RA. Further, we found minimal enrichment between ALS and the immune-mediated diseases tested, with the highest levels of enrichment between ALS and RA (up to 20-fold). For FTD, at a conjunction false discovery rate {\textless} 0.05 and after excluding SNPs in linkage disequilibrium, we found that 8 of the 15 identified loci mapped to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on Chromosome (Chr) 6. We also found novel candidate FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TBK1 binding protein 1), and PGBD5 (piggyBac transposable element derived 5). Functionally, we found that the expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with FTD and is enriched in microglia/macrophages compared to other central nervous system cell types. The main study limitation is that the results represent only clinically diagnosed individuals. Also, given the complex interconnectedness of the HLA region, we were not able to define the specific gene or genes on Chr 6 responsible for our pleiotropic signal.
CONCLUSIONS: We show immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to FTD risk. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.},

	abstract = {The very slow progression of behavioral disorders, initially isolated at the onset of frontotemporal dementia, easily results in their neglect, all the more so since the patients are anosognosic. In absence of cognitive decline, these patients, whatever carrying a neurological disease, are frequently led towards psychiatrists. Many psychiatric disorders may be evoked: depression, mania, compulsive obsessive disorder, psychopathy, alcoholic addiction, bulimia, schizophrenia, or Diogene syndrome. However, the diagnosis can often be easily corrected by a detailed clinical analysis. The knowledge of the 3 behavioral symptoms included in the diagnostic criteria can help to recognize frontotemporal dementia, even when imaging and neuropsychological data show mild abnormalities. In the last few years, various neuropsychological, biological and environmental mechanisms have been proposed to explain the behavioral disorders. These disorders are very difficult to tolerate by the caregivers because the patients appear to be asocial and show no affect. A detailed information of the changes related to the disease is important for the caregivers to accept the behavioral changes and to cope with them. However, over time, the occurrence of mutism may lead caregivers to regret the period of behavioral disorders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) administered within 7 days after stroke predicts long-term cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and mortality.
METHODS: MoCA was administered to 274 patients from 2 prospective hospital-based cohort studies in Germany (n = 125) and France (n = 149). Cognitive and functional outcomes were assessed at 6, 12, and 36 months after stroke by comprehensive neuropsychological testing, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and analyzed with generalized estimating equations. All-cause mortality was investigated by Cox proportional hazard models. Analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, education, vascular risk factors, premorbid cognitive status, and NIH Stroke Scale scores. The additive predictive value of MoCA was examined with receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: In pooled analyses, a baseline MoCA score {\textless}26 was associated with cognitive impairment, defined by neuropsychological testing (odds ratio [OR] 5.30, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.75-10.22) and by CDR score ≥0.5 (OR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.53-4.18); functional impairment, defined by mRS score {\textgreater}2 (OR 5.03, 95\% CI 2.20-11.51) and by IADL score {\textless}8 (OR 2.48, 95\% CI 1.40-4.38); and mortality (hazard ratio 7.24, 95\% CI 1.99-26.35) across the 3-year follow-up. Patients with MoCA score {\textless}26 performed worse across all prespecified cognitive domains (executive function/attention, memory, language, visuospatial ability). MoCA increased the area under the curve for predicting cognitive impairment (neuropsychological testing 0.81 vs 0.72, p = 0.01) and functional impairment (mRS score {\textgreater}2, 0.88 vs 0.84, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSION: Early cognitive testing by MoCA predicts long-term cognitive outcome, functional outcome, and mortality after stroke. Our results support routine use of the MoCA in stroke patients.},

Only original studies having measured PSF and potentially associated factors were included. Data was extracted from articles using predefined data fields. Results. Although PSF tends to be more frequent in female patients and older patients, sociodemographic factors do not appear to have a major impact. There are strong associations between PSF and emotional disturbances (such as depression and anxiety). PSF may also be linked to attentional disturbances (mainly slowing in processing speed). The literature data have failed to demonstrate a clear impact of the type and severity of stroke. It has been suggested that PSF results from alterations in the frontothalamostriatal system and/or inflammatory processes. Pain, sleep disorders, and prestroke fatigue also appeared to be associated with PSF. Implications. A better understanding of PSF may improve stroke patient care and facilitate the development of effective treatments.},
